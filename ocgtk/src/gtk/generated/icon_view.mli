external unset_model_drag_source : t -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_unset_model_drag_source"
(** Undoes the effect of gtk_icon_view_enable_model_drag_source(). Calling this
    method sets `GtkIconView`:reorderable to %FALSE. *)

external unset_model_drag_dest : t -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_unset_model_drag_dest"
(** Undoes the effect of gtk_icon_view_enable_model_drag_dest(). Calling this
    method sets `GtkIconView`:reorderable to %FALSE. *)

external unselect_path : t -> Tree_path.t -> unit

(** Unselects the row at @path. *)

external unselect_all : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_unselect_all"
(** Unselects all the icons. *)

external set_tooltip_item : t -> Tooltip.t -> Tree_path.t -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_item"
(** Sets the tip area of @tooltip to be the area covered by the item at @path.
See also gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_column() for a simpler alternative.
See also gtk_tooltip_set_tip_area(). *)

external set_tooltip_column : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_column"
(** If you only plan to have simple (text-only) tooltips on full items, you
can use this function to have `GtkIconView` handle these automatically
for you. @column should be set to the column in @icon_view’s model
containing the tooltip texts, or -1 to disable this feature.

When enabled, `GtkWidget:has-tooltip` will be set to %TRUE and
@icon_view will connect a `GtkWidget::query-tooltip` signal handler.

Note that the signal handler sets the text with gtk_tooltip_set_markup(),
so &, <, etc have to be escaped in the text. *)

external set_tooltip_cell :
  t -> Tooltip.t -> Tree_path.t -> Cell_renderer.t option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_cell"
(** Sets the tip area of @tooltip to the area which @cell occupies in
the item pointed to by @path. See also gtk_tooltip_set_tip_area().

See also gtk_icon_view_set_tooltip_column() for a simpler alternative. *)

external set_text_column : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_text_column"
(** Sets the column with text for @icon_view to be @column. The text
column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`. *)

external set_spacing : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_spacing"
(** Sets the ::spacing property which specifies the space which is inserted
    between the cells (i.e. the icon and the text) of an item. *)

(** Sets the selection mode of the @icon_view. *)

external set_row_spacing : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_row_spacing"
(** Sets the ::row-spacing property which specifies the space which is inserted
    between the rows of the icon view. *)

external set_reorderable : t -> bool -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_reorderable"
(** This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder models that
support the `GtkTreeDragSourceIface` and the `GtkTreeDragDestIface`. Both
`GtkTreeStore` and `GtkListStore` support these. If @reorderable is %TRUE, then
the user can reorder the model by dragging and dropping rows.  The
developer can listen to these changes by connecting to the model's
row_inserted and row_deleted signals. The reordering is implemented by setting up
the icon view as a drag source and destination. Therefore, drag and
drop can not be used in a reorderable view for any other purpose.

This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- any
reordering is allowed.  If more control is needed, you should probably
handle drag and drop manually. *)

external set_pixbuf_column : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_pixbuf_column"
(** Sets the column with pixbufs for @icon_view to be @column. The pixbuf
column must be of type `GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF` *)

external set_model : t -> Tree_model.t option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_model"
(** Sets the model for a `GtkIconView`.
If the @icon_view already has a model set, it will remove
it before setting the new model.  If @model is %NULL, then
it will unset the old model. *)

external set_markup_column : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_markup_column"
(** Sets the column with markup information for @icon_view to be
@column. The markup column must be of type `G_TYPE_STRING`.
If the markup column is set to something, it overrides
the text column set by gtk_icon_view_set_text_column(). *)

external set_margin : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_margin"
(** Sets the ::margin property which specifies the space which is inserted at
    the top, bottom, left and right of the icon view. *)

external set_item_width : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_item_width"
(** Sets the ::item-width property which specifies the width to use for each
    item. If it is set to -1, the icon view will automatically determine a
    suitable item size. *)

external set_item_padding : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_item_padding"
(** Sets the `GtkIconView`:item-padding property which specifies the padding
    around each of the icon view’s items. *)

external set_item_orientation : t -> Gtk_enums.orientation -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_item_orientation"
(** Sets the ::item-orientation property which determines whether the labels are
    drawn beside the icons instead of below. *)

(** Sets the item that is highlighted for feedback. *)

external set_cursor : t -> Tree_path.t -> Cell_renderer.t option -> bool -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_cursor"
(** Sets the current keyboard focus to be at @path, and selects it.  This is
useful when you want to focus the user’s attention on a particular item.
If @cell is not %NULL, then focus is given to the cell specified by
it. Additionally, if @start_editing is %TRUE, then editing should be
started in the specified cell.

This function is often followed by `gtk_widget_grab_focus
(icon_view)` in order to give keyboard focus to the widget.
Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is realized. *)

external set_columns : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_columns"
(** Sets the ::columns property which determines in how
many columns the icons are arranged. If @columns is
-1, the number of columns will be chosen automatically
to fill the available area. *)

external set_column_spacing : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_column_spacing"
(** Sets the ::column-spacing property which specifies the space which is
    inserted between the columns of the icon view. *)

external set_activate_on_single_click : t -> bool -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_set_activate_on_single_click"
(** Causes the `GtkIconView`::item-activated signal to be emitted on a single
    click instead of a double click. *)

(** Selects the row at @path. *)

external select_all : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_icon_view_select_all"
(** Selects all the icons. @icon_view must has its selection mode set
to %GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE. *)

external scroll_to_path : t -> Tree_path.t -> bool -> float -> float -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_scroll_to_path"
(** Moves the alignments of @icon_view to the position specified by @path.
@row_align determines where the row is placed, and @col_align determines
where @column is placed.  Both are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means
center.

If @use_align is %FALSE, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and the
tree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the item onto the screen.
This means that the item will be scrolled to the edge closest to its current
position.  If the item is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.

This function only works if the model is set, and @path is a valid row on
the model. If the model changes before the @icon_view is realized, the
centered path will be modified to reflect this change. *)

external path_is_selected : t -> Tree_path.t -> bool
  = "ml_gtk_icon_view_path_is_selected"
(** Returns %TRUE if the icon pointed to by @path is currently
selected. If @path does not point to a valid location, %FALSE is returned. *)

(** Creates a list of paths of all selected items. Additionally, if you are
planning on modifying the model after calling this function, you may
want to convert the returned list into a list of `GtkTreeRowReferences`.
To do this, you can use gtk_tree_row_reference_new().

To free the return value, use `g_list_free_full`:

GtkWidget *icon_view = gtk_icon_view_new ();
// Use icon_view

GList *list = gtk_icon_view_get_selected_items (GTK_ICON_VIEW (icon_view));
