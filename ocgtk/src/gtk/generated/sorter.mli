(* Sorter: Sorter *)

type t = [ `sorter | `object_ ] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)

external get_order : t -> Gtk_enums.sorterorder = "ml_gtk_sorter_get_order"
(** Gets the order that @self conforms to.

See [enum@Gtk.SorterOrder] for details
of the possible return values.

This function is intended to allow optimizations. *)

external compare :
  t ->
  [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj ->
  [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj ->
  Gtk_enums.ordering = "ml_gtk_sorter_compare"
(** Compares two given items according to the sort order implemented by the
    sorter.

    Sorters implement a partial order:

    * It is reflexive, ie a = a * It is antisymmetric, ie if a < b and b < a,
    then a = b * It is transitive, ie given any 3 items with a ≤ b and b ≤ c,
    then a ≤ c

    The sorter may signal it conforms to additional constraints via the return
    value of [method@Gtk.Sorter.get_order]. *)

external changed : t -> Gtk_enums.sorterchange -> unit = "ml_gtk_sorter_changed"
(** Notifies all users of the sorter that it has changed.

This emits the [signal@Gtk.Sorter::changed] signal. Users
of the sorter should then update the sort order via
[method@Gtk.Sorter.compare].

Depending on the @change parameter, it may be possible to
update the sort order without a full resorting. Refer to
the [enum@Gtk.SorterChange] documentation for details.

This function is intended for implementers of `GtkSorter`
subclasses and should not be called from other functions. *)
