(* Methods *)

external set_theme_name : t -> string option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_theme_set_theme_name"
(** Sets the name of the icon theme that the `GtkIconTheme` object uses
    overriding system configuration.

    This function cannot be called on the icon theme objects returned from
    [func@Gtk.IconTheme.get_for_display]. *)

external set_search_path : t -> string array option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_theme_set_search_path"
(** Sets the search path for the icon theme object.

When looking for an icon theme, GTK will search for a subdirectory
of one or more of the directories in @path with the same name
as the icon theme containing an index.theme file. (Themes from
multiple of the path elements are combined to allow themes to be
extended by adding icons in the user’s home directory.)

In addition if an icon found isn’t found either in the current
icon theme or the default icon theme, and an image file with
the right name is found directly in one of the elements of
@path, then that image will be used for the icon name.
(This is legacy feature, and new icons should be put
into the fallback icon theme, which is called hicolor,
rather than directly on the icon path.) *)

external set_resource_path : t -> string array option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_icon_theme_set_resource_path"
(** Sets the resource paths that will be looked at when looking for icons,
    similar to search paths.

    The resources are considered as part of the hicolor icon theme and must be
    located in subdirectories that are defined in the hicolor icon theme, such
    as `@path/16x16/actions/run.png` or `@path/scalable/actions/run.svg`.

    Icons that are directly placed in the resource path instead of a
    subdirectory are also considered as ultimate fallback, but they are treated
    like unthemed icons. *)

(** Looks up a named icon for a desired size and window scale,
returning a `GtkIconPaintable`.

The icon can then be rendered by using it as a `GdkPaintable`,
or you can get information such as the filename and size.

If the available @icon_name is not available and @fallbacks are
provided, they will be tried in order.

If no matching icon is found, then a paintable that renders the
"missing icon" icon is returned. If you need to do something else
for missing icons you need to use [method@Gtk.IconTheme.has_icon].

Note that you probably want to listen for icon theme changes and
update the icon. This is usually done by overriding the
GtkWidgetClass.css-changed() function. *)

  = "ml_gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path"
(** Adds a resource path that will be looked at when looking for icons, similar
    to search paths.

    See [method@Gtk.IconTheme.set_resource_path].

    This function should be used to make application-specific icons available as
    part of the icon theme. *)
