(* Methods *)

external set_content_width : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_drawing_area_set_content_width"
(** Sets the desired width of the contents of the drawing area.

    Note that because widgets may be allocated larger sizes than they requested,
    it is possible that the actual width passed to your draw function is larger
    than the width set here. You can use [method@Gtk.Widget.set_halign] to avoid
    that.

    If the width is set to 0 (the default), the drawing area may disappear. *)

external set_content_height : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_drawing_area_set_content_height"
(** Sets the desired height of the contents of the drawing area.

    Note that because widgets may be allocated larger sizes than they requested,
    it is possible that the actual height passed to your draw function is larger
    than the height set here. You can use [method@Gtk.Widget.set_valign] to
    avoid that.

    If the height is set to 0 (the default), the drawing area may disappear. *)

(** Retrieves the content width of the `GtkDrawingArea`. *)
