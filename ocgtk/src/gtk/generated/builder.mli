(* Methods *)
(** Sets the translation domain of @builder. *)
external set_translation_domain : t -> string option -> unit = "ml_gtk_builder_set_translation_domain"

(** Sets the scope the builder should operate in.

If @scope is %NULL, a new [class@Gtk.BuilderCScope] will be created. *)
external set_scope : t -> Builder_scope.t option -> unit = "ml_gtk_builder_set_scope"

(** Sets the current object for the @builder.

The current object can be thought of as the `this` object that the
builder is working for and will often be used as the default object
when an object is optional.

[method@Gtk.Widget.init_template] for example will set the current
object to the widget the template is inited for. For functions like
[ctor@Gtk.Builder.new_from_resource], the current object will be %NULL. *)

(** Gets all objects that have been constructed by @builder.

Note that this function does not increment the reference
counts of the returned objects. *)

(** Gets the object named @name.

Note that this function does not increment the reference count
of the returned object. *)

(** Add @object to the @builder object pool so it can be
referenced just like any other object built by builder.

Only a single object may be added using @name. However,
it is not an error to expose the same object under multiple
names. `gtk_builder_get_object()` may be used to determine
if an object has already been added with @name. *)

(** Parses a resource file containing a UI definition, building
only the requested objects and merges them with the current
contents of @builder.

Upon errors, 0 will be returned and @error will be assigned a
`GError` from the %GTK_BUILDER_ERROR, %G_MARKUP_ERROR or %G_RESOURCE_ERROR
domain.

If you are adding an object that depends on an object that is not
its child (for instance a `GtkTreeView` that depends on its
`GtkTreeModel`), you have to explicitly list all of them in @object_ids. *)

(** Parses a resource file containing a UI definition
and merges it with the current contents of @builder.

This function is useful if you need to call
[method@Gtk.Builder.set_current_object] to add user data to
callbacks before loading GtkBuilder UI. Otherwise, you probably
want [ctor@Gtk.Builder.new_from_resource] instead.

If an error occurs, 0 will be returned and @error will be assigned a
`GError` from the %GTK_BUILDER_ERROR, %G_MARKUP_ERROR or %G_RESOURCE_ERROR
domain.

It’s not really reasonable to attempt to handle failures of this
call.  The only reasonable thing to do when an error is detected is
to call g_error(). *)

files that are not part of your application). Broken `GtkBuilder`
files can easily crash your program, and it’s possible that memory
was leaked leading up to the reported failure. The only reasonable
thing to do when an error is detected is to call `g_error()`. *)
