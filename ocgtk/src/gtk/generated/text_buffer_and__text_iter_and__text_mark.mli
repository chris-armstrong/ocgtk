  external undo : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_undo"

  (** Deletes current contents of @buffer, and inserts @text instead. This is
  automatically marked as an irreversible action in the undo stack. If you
  wish to mark this action as part of a larger undo operation, call
  [method@TextBuffer.delete] and [method@TextBuffer.insert] directly instead.

  If @len is -1, @text must be nul-terminated.
  @text must be valid UTF-8. *)
  external set_text : t -> string -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_set_text"

  (** Used to keep track of whether the buffer has been
  modified since the last time it was saved.

  Whenever the buffer is saved to disk, call
  `gtk_text_buffer_set_modified (@buffer, FALSE)`.
  When the buffer is modified, it will automatically
  toggle on the modified bit again. When the modified
  bit flips, the buffer emits the
  [signal@Gtk.TextBuffer::modified-changed] signal. *)
  external set_modified : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_set_modified"

  (** Sets the maximum number of undo levels to perform.

  If 0, unlimited undo actions may be performed. Note that this may

  external set_max_undo_levels : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_set_max_undo_levels"

  (** Sets whether or not to enable undoable actions in the text buffer.

  Undoable actions in this context are changes to the text content of
  the buffer. Changes to tags and marks are not tracked.

  If enabled, the user will be able to undo the last number of actions
  up to [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_max_undo_levels].

  See [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.begin_irreversible_action] and

  If you move them in two steps with
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.move_mark], you will temporarily select a
  region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
  inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
  to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can
  be optimized. *)
  external select_range : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_select_range"

  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.remove_tag]. *)
  external remove_tag_by_name : t -> string -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_remove_tag_by_name"

  unrelated to the code you’re currently writing. That is, using this
  function is probably a bad idea if you have two or more unrelated
  code sections that add tags. *)

  (** This function moves the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks
  simultaneously.

  If you move them to the same place in two steps with
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.move_mark], you will temporarily select a
  region in between their old and new locations, which can be pretty
  inefficient since the temporarily-selected region will force stuff
  to be recalculated. This function moves them as a unit, which can

  external move_mark_by_name : t -> string -> Text_iter.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_move_mark_by_name"

  Emits the [signal@Gtk.TextBuffer::mark-set] signal
  as notification of the move. *)

  (** Copies text, tags, and paintables between @start and @end
  and inserts the copy at @iter.

  Same as [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.insert_range], but does nothing
  if the insertion point isn’t editable. The @default_editable
  parameter indicates whether the text is editable at @iter if
  no tags enclosing @iter affect editability. Typically the result
  of [method@Gtk.TextView.get_editable] is appropriate here. *)
  external insert_range_interactive : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> bool -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_range_interactive"

  (** Copies text, tags, and paintables between @start and @end
  and inserts the copy at @iter.

  The order of @start and @end doesn’t matter.

  Used instead of simply getting/inserting text because it preserves
  images and tags. If @start and @end are in a different buffer from
  @buffer, the two buffers must share the same tag table.

  Implemented via emissions of the ::insert-text and ::apply-tag signals,
  so expect those. *)
  external insert_range : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_range"

  (** Inserts the text in @markup at position @iter.

  @markup will be inserted in its entirety and must be nul-terminated
  and valid UTF-8. Emits the [signal@Gtk.TextBuffer::insert-text] signal,
  possibly multiple times; insertion actually occurs in the default handler
  for the signal. @iter will point to the end of the inserted text on return. *)
  external insert_markup : t -> Text_iter.t -> string -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_markup"

  (** Inserts @text in @buffer.

  Calls [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.insert_interactive]
  at the cursor position.

  @default_editable indicates the editability of text that doesn't
  have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
  result of [method@Gtk.TextView.get_editable] is appropriate here. *)
  external insert_interactive_at_cursor : t -> string -> int -> bool -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_interactive_at_cursor"

  (** Inserts @text in @buffer.

  Like [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.insert], but the insertion will not occur
  if @iter is at a non-editable location in the buffer. Usually you
  want to prevent insertions at ineditable locations if the insertion
  results from a user action (is interactive).

  @default_editable indicates the editability of text that doesn't
  have a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically the
  result of [method@Gtk.TextView.get_editable] is appropriate here. *)
  external insert_interactive : t -> Text_iter.t -> string -> int -> bool -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_interactive"

  (** Inserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at @iter.

  The anchor will be counted as one character in character counts, and
  when obtaining the buffer contents as a string, will be represented
  by the Unicode “object replacement character” 0xFFFC. Note that the
  “slice” variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string
  include this character for child anchors, but the “text” variants do
  not. E.g. see [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_slice] and
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_text].

  Consider [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.create_child_anchor] as a more
  convenient alternative to this function. The buffer will add a
  reference to the anchor, so you can unref it after insertion. *)
  external insert_child_anchor : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_child_anchor.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_child_anchor"

  (** Inserts @text in @buffer.

  Simply calls [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.insert],
  using the current cursor position as the insertion point. *)
  external insert_at_cursor : t -> string -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert_at_cursor"

  (** Inserts @len bytes of @text at position @iter.

  If @len is -1, @text must be nul-terminated and will be inserted in its
  entirety. Emits the “insert-text” signal; insertion actually occurs
  in the default handler for the signal. @iter is invalidated when
  insertion occurs (because the buffer contents change), but the
  default signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of the
  inserted text. *)
  external insert : t -> Text_iter.t -> string -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_insert"

  (** Returns the text in the range [@start,@end).

  Excludes undisplayed text (text marked with tags that set the
  invisibility attribute) if @include_hidden_chars is %FALSE.
  Does not include characters representing embedded images, so
  byte and character indexes into the returned string do not
  correspond to byte and character indexes into the buffer.
  Contrast with [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_slice]. *)
  external get_text : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> bool -> string = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_text"

  (** Get the `GtkTextTagTable` associated with this buffer. *)
  external get_tag_table : t -> Text_tag_table.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_tag_table"

  (** Initialized @iter with the first position in the text buffer.

  This is the same as using [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_iter_at_offset]
  to get the iter at character offset 0. *)
  external get_start_iter : t -> Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_start_iter"

  (** Returns the text in the range [@start,@end).

  Excludes undisplayed text (text marked with tags that set the
  invisibility attribute) if @include_hidden_chars is %FALSE.
  The returned string includes a 0xFFFC character whenever the
  buffer contains embedded images, so byte and character indexes
  into the returned string do correspond to byte and character
  indexes into the buffer. Contrast with [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_text].
  Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normal text as well, so it is not a
  reliable indicator that a paintable or widget is in the buffer. *)
  external get_slice : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> bool -> string = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_slice"

  (** Returns %TRUE if some text is selected; places the bounds
  of the selection in @start and @end.

  If the selection has length 0, then @start and @end are filled
  in with the same value. @start and @end will be in ascending order.
  If @start and @end are %NULL, then they are not filled in, but the
  return value still indicates whether text is selected. *)
  external get_selection_bounds : t -> bool * Text_iter.t * Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_selection_bounds"

  (** Returns the mark that represents the selection bound.

  Equivalent to calling [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_mark]
  to get the mark named “selection_bound”, but very slightly
  more efficient, and involves less typing.

  The currently-selected text in @buffer is the region between the
  “selection_bound” and “insert” marks. If “selection_bound” and
  “insert” are in the same place, then there is no current selection.
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_selection_bounds] is another convenient
  function for handling the selection, if you just want to know whether
  there’s a selection and what its bounds are. *)
  external get_selection_bound : t -> Text_mark.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_selection_bound"

  (** Indicates whether the buffer has been modified since the last call
  to [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.set_modified] set the modification flag to
  %FALSE.

  Used for example to enable a “save” function in a text editor. *)
  external get_modified : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_modified"

  (** Gets the maximum number of undo levels to perform.

  If 0, unlimited undo actions may be performed. Note that this may
  have a memory usage impact as it requires storing an additional
  copy of the inserted or removed text within the text buffer. *)
  external get_max_undo_levels : t -> int = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_max_undo_levels"

  (** Returns the mark named @name in buffer @buffer, or %NULL if no such
  mark exists in the buffer. *)
  external get_mark : t -> string -> Text_mark.t option = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_mark"

  (** Obtains the number of lines in the buffer.

  This value is cached, so the function is very fast. *)
  external get_line_count : t -> int = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_line_count"

  (** Initializes @iter to a position @char_offset chars from the start
  of the entire buffer.

  If @char_offset is -1 or greater than the number
  of characters in the buffer, @iter is initialized to the end iterator,
  the iterator one past the last valid character in the buffer. *)

  (** Obtains an iterator pointing to @char_offset within the given line.

  Note characters, not bytes; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple
  bytes.

  If @line_number is greater than or equal to the number of lines in the @buffer,
  the end iterator is returned. And if @char_offset is off the
  end of the line, the iterator at the end of the line is returned. *)
  external get_iter_at_line_offset : t -> int -> int -> bool * Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_line_offset"

  (** Obtains an iterator pointing to @byte_index within the given line.

  @byte_index must be the start of a UTF-8 character. Note bytes, not
  characters; UTF-8 may encode one character as multiple bytes.

  If @line_number is greater than or equal to the number of lines in the @buffer,
  the end iterator is returned. And if @byte_index is off the
  end of the line, the iterator at the end of the line is returned. *)
  external get_iter_at_line_index : t -> int -> int -> bool * Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_line_index"

  (** Initializes @iter to the start of the given line.

  If @line_number is greater than or equal to the number of lines
  in the @buffer, the end iterator is returned. *)
  external get_iter_at_line : t -> int -> bool * Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_line"

  (** Obtains the location of @anchor within @buffer. *)
  external get_iter_at_child_anchor : t -> Text_child_anchor.t -> Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_child_anchor"

  (** Returns the mark that represents the cursor (insertion point).

  Equivalent to calling [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_mark]
  to get the mark named “insert”, but very slightly more
  efficient, and involves less typing. *)
  external get_insert : t -> Text_mark.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_insert"

  (** Indicates whether the buffer has some text currently selected. *)
  external get_has_selection : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_has_selection"

  (** Initializes @iter with the “end iterator,” one past the last valid
  character in the text buffer.

  If dereferenced with [method@Gtk.TextIter.get_char], the end
  iterator has a character value of 0.
  The entire buffer lies in the range from the first position in
  the buffer (call [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_start_iter] to get
  character position 0) to the end iterator. *)
  external get_end_iter : t -> Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_end_iter"

  (** Gets whether the buffer is saving modifications to the buffer
  to allow for undo and redo actions.

  See [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.begin_irreversible_action] and
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.end_irreversible_action] to create
  changes to the buffer that cannot be undone. *)
  external get_enable_undo : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_enable_undo"

  (** Gets the number of characters in the buffer.

  Note that characters and bytes are not the same, you can’t e.g.
  expect the contents of the buffer in string form to be this
  many bytes long.

  The character count is cached, so this function is very fast. *)
  external get_char_count : t -> int = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_char_count"

  (** Gets whether there is an undoable action in the history. *)
  external get_can_undo : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_can_undo"

  (** Gets whether there is a redoable action in the history. *)
  external get_can_redo : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_can_redo"

  (** Retrieves the first and last iterators in the buffer, i.e. the
  entire buffer lies within the range [@start,@end). *)
  external get_bounds : t -> Text_iter.t * Text_iter.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_get_bounds"

  (** Ends a user-visible operation.

  Should be paired with a call to
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.begin_user_action].
  See that function for a full explanation. *)
  external end_user_action : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_end_user_action"

  (** Denotes the end of an action that may not be undone.

  This will cause any previous operations in the undo/redo
  queue to be cleared.

  This should be called after completing modifications to the
  text buffer after [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.begin_irreversible_action]
  was called.

  You may nest calls to gtk_text_buffer_begin_irreversible_action()
  and gtk_text_buffer_end_irreversible_action() pairs. *)
  external end_irreversible_action : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_end_irreversible_action"

  (** Deletes the range between the “insert” and “selection_bound” marks,
  that is, the currently-selected text.

  If @interactive is %TRUE, the editability of the selection will be
  considered (users can’t delete uneditable text). *)
  external delete_selection : t -> bool -> bool -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_delete_selection"

  (** Deletes the mark named @name; the mark must exist.

  See [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.delete_mark] for details. *)
  external delete_mark_by_name : t -> string -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark_by_name"

  (** Deletes @mark, so that it’s no longer located anywhere in the
  buffer.

  Removes the reference the buffer holds to the mark, so if
  you haven’t called g_object_ref() on the mark, it will be freed.
  Even if the mark isn’t freed, most operations on @mark become
  invalid, until it gets added to a buffer again with
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.add_mark]. Use [method@Gtk.TextMark.get_deleted]
  to find out if a mark has been removed from its buffer.

  The [signal@Gtk.TextBuffer::mark-deleted] signal will be emitted as
  notification after the mark is deleted. *)
  external delete_mark : t -> Text_mark.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark"

  (** Deletes all editable text in the given range.

  Calls [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.delete] for each editable
  sub-range of [@start,@end). @start and @end are revalidated
  to point to the location of the last deleted range, or left
  untouched if no text was deleted. *)
  external delete_interactive : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> bool -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_delete_interactive"

  (** Deletes text between @start and @end.

  The order of @start and @end is not actually relevant;
  gtk_text_buffer_delete() will reorder them.

  This function actually emits the “delete-range” signal, and
  the default handler of that signal deletes the text. Because the
  buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become invalid after
  calling this function; however, the @start and @end will be
  re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted. *)
  external delete : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_delete"

  (** Creates a mark at position @where.

  If @mark_name is %NULL, the mark is anonymous; otherwise, the mark
  can be retrieved by name using [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_mark].
  If a mark has left gravity, and text is inserted at the mark’s
  current location, the mark will be moved to the left of the
  newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity
  (@left_gravity = %FALSE), the mark will end up on the right of
  newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a mark
  with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the right
  side of the text you’re typing).

  The caller of this function does not own a
  reference to the returned `GtkTextMark`, so you can ignore the
  return value if you like. Marks are owned by the buffer and go
  away when the buffer does.

  Emits the [signal@Gtk.TextBuffer::mark-set] signal as notification
  of the mark's initial placement. *)
  external create_mark : t -> string option -> Text_iter.t -> bool -> Text_mark.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_create_mark"

  (** Creates and inserts a child anchor.

  This is a convenience function which simply creates a child anchor
  with [ctor@Gtk.TextChildAnchor.new] and inserts it into the buffer
  with [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.insert_child_anchor].

  The new anchor is owned by the buffer; no reference count is
  returned to the caller of this function. *)
  external create_child_anchor : t -> Text_iter.t -> Text_child_anchor.t = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_create_child_anchor"

  (** Called to indicate that the buffer operations between here and a
  call to gtk_text_buffer_end_user_action() are part of a single
  user-visible operation.

  The operations between gtk_text_buffer_begin_user_action() and
  gtk_text_buffer_end_user_action() can then be grouped when creating
  an undo stack. `GtkTextBuffer` maintains a count of calls to
  gtk_text_buffer_begin_user_action() that have not been closed with
  a call to gtk_text_buffer_end_user_action(), and emits the
  “begin-user-action” and “end-user-action” signals only for the
  outermost pair of calls. This allows you to build user actions
  from other user actions.

  The “interactive” buffer mutation functions, such as
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.insert_interactive], automatically call
  begin/end user action around the buffer operations they perform,
  so there's no need to add extra calls if you user action consists
  solely of a single call to one of those functions. *)
  external begin_user_action : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_begin_user_action"

  (** Denotes the beginning of an action that may not be undone.

  This will cause any previous operations in the undo/redo queue
  to be cleared.

  This should be paired with a call to
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.end_irreversible_action] after the irreversible
  action has completed.

  You may nest calls to gtk_text_buffer_begin_irreversible_action()
  and gtk_text_buffer_end_irreversible_action() pairs. *)
  external begin_irreversible_action : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_begin_irreversible_action"

  (** Performs the appropriate action as if the user hit the delete
  key with the cursor at the position specified by @iter.

  In the normal case a single character will be deleted, but when
  combining accents are involved, more than one character can
  be deleted, and when precomposed character and accent combinations
  are involved, less than one character will be deleted.

  Because the buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become
  invalid after calling this function; however, the @iter will be
  re-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted. *)
  external backspace : t -> Text_iter.t -> bool -> bool -> bool = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_backspace"

  (** Emits the “apply-tag” signal on @buffer.

  Calls [method@Gtk.TextTagTable.lookup] on the buffer’s
  tag table to get a `GtkTextTag`, then calls
  [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.apply_tag]. *)
  external apply_tag_by_name : t -> string -> Text_iter.t -> Text_iter.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_text_buffer_apply_tag_by_name"

  (** Adds the mark at position @where.

  The mark must not be added to another buffer, and if its name
  is not %NULL then there must not be another mark in the buffer
  with the same name.

  Emits the [signal@Gtk.TextBuffer::mark-set] signal as notification
  of the mark's initial placement. *)

  (** Returns %TRUE if @tag is toggled on at exactly this point.

  If @tag is %NULL, returns %TRUE if any tag is toggled on at this point.

  Note that if this function returns %TRUE, it means that
  @iter is at the beginning of the tagged range, and that the
  character at @iter is inside the tagged range. In other
  words, unlike [method@Gtk.TextIter.ends_tag], if
  this function returns %TRUE, [method@Gtk.TextIter.has_tag]
  will also return %TRUE for the same parameters. *)

  (** Returns %TRUE if @iter begins a paragraph.

  This is the case if [method@Gtk.TextIter.get_line_offset]
  would return 0. However this function is potentially more
  efficient than [method@Gtk.TextIter.get_line_offset], because
  it doesn’t have to compute the offset, it just has to see

  return followed by a newline, or a Unicode paragraph separator
  character.

  Note that an iterator pointing to the \n of a \r\n pair will not be

  You don’t want to use this function to decide whether text can be
