(* Methods *)

external render_page : t -> int -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_print_operation_preview_render_page"
(** Renders a page to the preview.

This is using the print context that was passed to the
[signal@Gtk.PrintOperation::preview] handler together
with @preview.

A custom print preview should use this function to render
the currently selected page.

Note that this function requires a suitable cairo context to
be associated with the print context. *)

(** Returns whether the given page is included in the set of pages that have
    been selected for printing. *)

external end_preview : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_print_operation_preview_end_preview"
(** Ends a preview.

    This function must be called to finish a custom print preview. *)
