external to_string : t -> string = "ml_gtk_css_section_to_string"
(** Prints the section into a human-readable text form using
    [method@Gtk.CssSection.print]. *)

external get_parent : t -> t option = "ml_gtk_css_section_get_parent"
(** Gets the parent section for the given `section`.

    The parent section is the section that contains this `section`. A special
    case are sections of type `GTK_CSS_SECTION_DOCUMEN`T. Their parent will
    either be `NULL` if they are the original CSS document that was loaded by
    [method@Gtk.CssProvider.load_from_file] or a section of type
    `GTK_CSS_SECTION_IMPORT` if it was loaded with an `@import` rule from a
    different file. *)

external get_file : t -> Ocgtk_gio.Gio.Wrappers.File.t option
  = "ml_gtk_css_section_get_file"
(** Gets the file that @section was parsed from.

If no such file exists, for example because the CSS was loaded via
[method@Gtk.CssProvider.load_from_data], then `NULL` is returned. *)

external get_end_location : t -> Css_location.t
  = "ml_gtk_css_section_get_end_location"
(** Returns the location in the CSS document where this section ends. *)
