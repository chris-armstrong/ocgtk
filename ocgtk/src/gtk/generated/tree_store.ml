external newv : int -> int array -> t = "ml_gtk_tree_store_newv"
(** Create a new TreeStore *)

(* Methods *)

external swap : t -> Tree_iter.t -> Tree_iter.t -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_swap"
(** Swaps @a and @b in the same level of @tree_store.

Note that this function only works with unsorted stores. *)

external set_column_types : t -> int -> int array -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_set_column_types"
(** Sets the type of the columns in a tree store.

    This function is meant primarily for types that inherit from `GtkTreeStore`,
    and should only be used when constructing a new `GtkTreeStore`.

    This functions cannot be called after a row has been added, or a method on
    the `GtkTreeModel` interface is called on the tree store. *)

external remove : t -> Tree_iter.t -> bool = "ml_gtk_tree_store_remove"
(** Removes @iter from @tree_store.

After being removed, @iter is set to the next valid row at that level, or
invalidated if it previously pointed to the last one. *)

external prepend : t -> Tree_iter.t option -> Tree_iter.t
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_prepend"
(** Prepends a new row to @tree_store.

If @parent is non-%NULL, then it will prepend the new row before the first
child of @parent, otherwise it will prepend a row to the top level. The
`iter` parameter will be changed to point to this new row.  The row will
be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to
call gtk_tree_store_set() or gtk_tree_store_set_value(). *)

external move_before : t -> Tree_iter.t -> Tree_iter.t option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_move_before"
(** Moves @iter in @tree_store to the position before @position.

@iter and @position should be in the same level.

Note that this function only works with unsorted stores.

If @position is %NULL, @iter will be moved to the end of the level. *)

external move_after : t -> Tree_iter.t -> Tree_iter.t option -> unit
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_move_after"
(** Moves @iter in @tree_store to the position after @position.

@iter and @position should be in the same level.

Note that this function only works with unsorted stores.

If @position is %NULL, @iter will be moved to the start of the level. *)

external iter_is_valid : t -> Tree_iter.t -> bool
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_iter_is_valid"
(** Checks if the given iter is a valid iter for this `GtkTreeStore`.

    This function is slow. Only use it for debugging and/or testing purposes. *)

external iter_depth : t -> Tree_iter.t -> int = "ml_gtk_tree_store_iter_depth"
(** Returns the depth of the position pointed by the iterator

    The depth will be 0 for anything on the root level, 1 for anything down a
    level, etc. *)

external is_ancestor : t -> Tree_iter.t -> Tree_iter.t -> bool
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_is_ancestor"
(** Checks if @iter is an ancestor of @descendant. *)

external insert_before :
  t -> Tree_iter.t option -> Tree_iter.t option -> Tree_iter.t
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_insert_before"
(** Inserts a new row before @sibling.

If @sibling is %NULL, then the row will be appended to @parent’s children.

If @parent and @sibling are %NULL, then the row will be appended to the
toplevel.

If both @sibling and @parent are set, then @parent must be the parent
of @sibling. When @sibling is set, @parent is optional.

The @iter parameter will be changed to point to this new row. The row will
be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
gtk_tree_store_set() or gtk_tree_store_set_value(). *)

external insert_after :
  t -> Tree_iter.t option -> Tree_iter.t option -> Tree_iter.t
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_insert_after"
(** Inserts a new row after @sibling.

If @sibling is %NULL, then the row will be prepended to @parent’s children.

If @parent and @sibling are %NULL, then the row will be prepended to the
toplevel.

If both @sibling and @parent are set, then @parent must be the parent
of @sibling. When @sibling is set, @parent is optional.

The @iter parameter will be changed to point to this new row. The row will

external insert : t -> Tree_iter.t option -> int -> Tree_iter.t
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_insert"
(** Creates a new row at @position.

If parent is non-%NULL, then the row will be made a child of @parent.
Otherwise, the row will be created at the toplevel.

If @position is `-1` or is larger than the number of rows at that level,
then the new row will be inserted to the end of the list.

The @iter parameter will be changed to point to this new row. The row
will be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you
need to call gtk_tree_store_set() or gtk_tree_store_set_value(). *)

external clear : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_tree_store_clear"
(** Removes all rows from @tree_store *)

external append : t -> Tree_iter.t option -> Tree_iter.t
  = "ml_gtk_tree_store_append"
(** Appends a new row to @tree_store.

If @parent is non-%NULL, then it will append the new row after the last
child of @parent, otherwise it will append a row to the top level.

The @iter parameter will be changed to point to this new row. The row will
be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call
gtk_tree_store_set() or gtk_tree_store_set_value(). *)
