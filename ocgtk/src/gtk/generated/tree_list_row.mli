(* Methods *)

external set_expanded : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_set_expanded"
(** Expands or collapses a row.

    If a row is expanded, the model of calling the
    [callback@Gtk.TreeListModelCreateModelFunc] for the row's item will be
    inserted after this row. If a row is collapsed, those items will be removed
    from the model.

    If the row is not expandable, this function does nothing. *)

external is_expandable : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_is_expandable"
(** Checks if a row can be expanded.

    This does not mean that the row is actually expanded, this can be checked
    with [method@Gtk.TreeListRow.get_expanded].

    If a row is expandable never changes until the row is removed from its model
    at which point it will forever return %FALSE. *)

external get_position : t -> int = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_position"
(** Returns the position in the `GtkTreeListModel` that @self occupies
at the moment. *)

external get_parent : t -> t option = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_parent"
(** Gets the row representing the parent for @self.

That is the row that would need to be collapsed
to make this row disappear.

If @self is a row corresponding to the root model,
%NULL is returned.

The value returned by this function never changes
until the row is removed from its model at which point
it will forever return %NULL. *)

external get_item : t -> [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj option
  = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_item"
(** Gets the item corresponding to this row, *)

external get_expanded : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_expanded"
(** Gets if a row is currently expanded. *)

external get_depth : t -> int = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_depth"
(** Gets the depth of this row.

    Rows that correspond to items in the root model have a depth of zero, rows
    corresponding to items of models of direct children of the root model have a
    depth of 1 and so on.

    The depth of a row never changes until the row is removed from its model at
    which point it will forever return 0. *)

external get_children : t -> Ocgtk_gio.Gio.Wrappers.List_model.t option
  = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_children"
(** If the row is expanded, gets the model holding the children of @self.

This model is the model created by the
[callback@Gtk.TreeListModelCreateModelFunc]
and contains the original items, no matter what value
[property@Gtk.TreeListModel:passthrough] is set to. *)

external get_child_row : t -> int -> t option
  = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_child_row"
(** If @self is not expanded or @position is greater than the
number of children, %NULL is returned. *)

(* Properties *)

external get_expandable : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_tree_list_row_get_expandable"
(** Get property: expandable *)
