type t = [`drag | `object_] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Sets the position of the drag surface that will be kept
under the cursor hotspot.

Initially, the hotspot is at the top left corner of the drag surface. *)
external set_hotspot : t -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_drag_set_hotspot"

(** Returns the `GdkSurface` where the drag originates. *)
external get_surface : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Surface.t = "ml_gdk_drag_get_surface"

(** Determines the action chosen by the drag destination. *)
external get_selected_action : t -> Gdk_enums.dragaction = "ml_gdk_drag_get_selected_action"

(** Retrieves the formats supported by this `GdkDrag` object. *)
external get_formats : t -> Content_formats.t = "ml_gdk_drag_get_formats"

(** Returns the surface on which the drag icon should be rendered
during the drag operation.

Note that the surface may not be available until the drag operation
has begun. GDK will move the surface in accordance with the ongoing
drag operation. The surface is owned by @drag and will be destroyed
when the drag operation is over. *)
external get_drag_surface : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Surface.t option = "ml_gdk_drag_get_drag_surface"

(** Gets the `GdkDisplay` that the drag object was created for. *)
external get_display : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Display.t = "ml_gdk_drag_get_display"

(** Returns the `GdkDevice` associated to the `GdkDrag` object. *)
external get_device : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Device.t = "ml_gdk_drag_get_device"

(** Returns the `GdkContentProvider` associated to the `GdkDrag` object. *)
external get_content : t -> Content_provider.t = "ml_gdk_drag_get_content"

(** Determines the bitmask of possible actions proposed by the source. *)
external get_actions : t -> Gdk_enums.dragaction = "ml_gdk_drag_get_actions"

(** Informs GDK that the drop ended.

Passing %FALSE for @success may trigger a drag cancellation
animation.

This function is called by the drag source, and should be the
last call before dropping the reference to the @drag.

The `GdkDrag` will only take the first [method@Gdk.Drag.drop_done]
call as effective, if this function is called multiple times,
all subsequent calls will be ignored. *)
