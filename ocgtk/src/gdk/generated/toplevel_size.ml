(** The `GdkToplevelSize` struct contains information that is useful
to compute the size of a toplevel. *)
type t = [`toplevel_size] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Sets the size the toplevel prefers to be resized to.

The size should be within the bounds (see
[method@Gdk.ToplevelSize.get_bounds]). The set size should
be considered as a hint, and should not be assumed to be
respected by the windowing system, or backend. *)
external set_size : t -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_toplevel_size_set_size"

(** Sets the shadows size of the toplevel.

The shadow width corresponds to the part of the computed surface size
that would consist of the shadow margin surrounding the window, would
there be any.

Shadow width should only be set if
[method@Gtk.Display.supports_shadow_width] is %TRUE. *)
external set_shadow_width : t -> int -> int -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_toplevel_size_set_shadow_width"

(** Sets the minimum size of the toplevel.

The minimum size corresponds to the limitations the toplevel can be shrunk
to, without resulting in incorrect painting. A user of a `GdkToplevel` should
calculate these given both the existing size, and the bounds retrieved from
the `GdkToplevelSize` object.

The minimum size should be within the bounds (see
[method@Gdk.ToplevelSize.get_bounds]). *)
external set_min_size : t -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_toplevel_size_set_min_size"

(** Retrieves the bounds the toplevel is placed within.

The bounds represent the largest size a toplevel may have while still being
able to fit within some type of boundary. Depending on the backend, this may
be equivalent to the dimensions of the work area or the monitor on which the
window is being presented on, or something else that limits the way a
toplevel can be presented. *)
