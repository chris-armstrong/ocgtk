(* Methods *)
(** Sets the width of the texture.

The width must be set before calling [method@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder.build]. *)
external set_width : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_width"

(** Sets the texture to be updated by this texture. See
[method@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder.set_update_region] for an explanation. *)
external set_update_texture : t -> Texture.t option -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_update_texture"

(** Sets the texture id of the texture. The texture id must remain unmodified
until the texture was finalized. See [method@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder.build]
for a longer discussion.

The id must be set before calling [method@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder.build]. *)
external set_id : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_id"

(** Sets the height of the texture.

The height must be set before calling [method@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder.build]. *)
external set_height : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_height"

(** Sets whether the texture has a mipmap. This allows the renderer and other users of the
generated texture to use a higher quality downscaling.

Typically, the `glGenerateMipmap` function is used to generate a mimap. *)
external set_has_mipmap : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_has_mipmap"

(** Sets the format of the texture. The default is `GDK_MEMORY_R8G8B8A8_PREMULTIPLIED`.

The format is the preferred format the texture data should be downloaded to. The
format must be supported by the GL version of [property@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder:context].

GDK's texture download code assumes that the format corresponds to the storage
parameters of the GL texture in an obvious way. For example, a format of
`GDK_MEMORY_R16G16B16A16_PREMULTIPLIED` is expected to be stored as `GL_RGBA16`
texture, and `GDK_MEMORY_G8A8` is expected to be stored as `GL_RG8` texture.

Setting the right format is particularly useful when using high bit depth textures
to preserve the bit depth, to set the correct value for unpremultiplied textures
and to make sure opaque textures are treated as such.

Non-RGBA textures need to have swizzling parameters set up properly to be usable
in GSK's shaders. *)
external set_format : t -> Gdk_enums.memoryformat -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_format"

(** Sets the context to be used for the texture. This is the context that owns
the texture.

The context must be set before calling [method@Gdk.GLTextureBuilder.build]. *)
external set_context : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Gl_context.t option -> unit = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_context"

(** Gets the width previously set via gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_width() or
0 if the width wasn't set. *)
external get_width : t -> int = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_get_width"

(** Gets the texture previously set via gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_update_texture() or
%NULL if none was set. *)
external get_update_texture : t -> Texture.t option = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_get_update_texture"

(** Gets the texture id previously set via gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_id() or
0 if the id wasn't set. *)
external get_id : t -> int = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_get_id"

(** Gets the height previously set via gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_height() or
0 if the height wasn't set. *)
external get_height : t -> int = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_get_height"

(** Gets whether the texture has a mipmap. *)
external get_has_mipmap : t -> bool = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_get_has_mipmap"

(** Gets the format previously set via gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_format(). *)
external get_format : t -> Gdk_enums.memoryformat = "ml_gdk_gl_texture_builder_get_format"

(** Gets the context previously set via gdk_gl_texture_builder_set_context() or
%NULL if none was set. *)
