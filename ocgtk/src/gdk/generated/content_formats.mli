(* ContentFormats: ContentFormats *)

(** The `GdkContentFormats` structure is used to advertise and negotiate the
format of content.

You will encounter `GdkContentFormats` when interacting with objects
controlling operations that pass data between different widgets, window
or application, like [class@Gdk.Drag], [class@Gdk.Drop],
[class@Gdk.Clipboard] or [class@Gdk.ContentProvider].

GDK supports content in 2 forms: `GType` and mime type.
Using `GTypes` is meant only for in-process content transfers. Mime types
are meant to be used for data passing both in-process and out-of-process.
The details of how data is passed is described in the documentation of
the actual implementations. To transform between the two forms,
[class@Gdk.ContentSerializer] and [class@Gdk.ContentDeserializer] are used.

A `GdkContentFormats` describes a set of possible formats content can be
exchanged in. It is assumed that this set is ordered. `GTypes` are more
important than mime types. Order between different `GTypes` or mime types
is the order they were added in, most important first. Functions that
care about order, such as [method@Gdk.ContentFormats.union], will describe
in their documentation how they interpret that order, though in general the
order of the first argument is considered the primary order of the result,
followed by the order of further arguments.

For debugging purposes, the function [method@Gdk.ContentFormats.to_string]
exists. It will print a comma-separated list of formats from most important
to least important.

`GdkContentFormats` is an immutable struct. After creation, you cannot change
the types it represents. Instead, new `GdkContentFormats` have to be created.
The [struct@Gdk.ContentFormatsBuilder] structure is meant to help in this
endeavor. *)

(* Methods *)
(** Decreases the reference count of a `GdkContentFormats` by one.

If the resulting reference count is zero, frees the formats. *)
external unref : t -> unit = "ml_gdk_content_formats_unref"

(** Add mime types for GTypes in @formats for which serializers are
registered. *)
external union_serialize_mime_types : t -> t = "ml_gdk_content_formats_union_serialize_mime_types"

(** Add GTypes for the mime types in @formats for which serializers are
registered. *)
external union_serialize_gtypes : t -> t = "ml_gdk_content_formats_union_serialize_gtypes"

(** Add mime types for GTypes in @formats for which deserializers are
registered. *)

(** Add GTypes for mime types in @formats for which deserializers are
registered. *)
external union_deserialize_gtypes : t -> t = "ml_gdk_content_formats_union_deserialize_gtypes"

(** Append all missing types from @second to @first, in the order
they had in @second. *)
external union : t -> t -> t = "ml_gdk_content_formats_union"

(** Prints the given @formats into a human-readable string.

The resulting string can be parsed with [func@Gdk.ContentFormats.parse].

This is a small wrapper around [method@Gdk.ContentFormats.print]
to help when debugging. *)

(** Increases the reference count of a `GdkContentFormats` by one. *)
external ref : t -> t = "ml_gdk_content_formats_ref"

(** Finds the first mime type from @first that is also contained
in @second.

If no matching mime type is found, %NULL is returned. *)

(** Checks if @first and @second have any matching formats. *)

(** Checks if a given mime type is part of the given @formats. *)
