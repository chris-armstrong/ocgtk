(* RGBA: RGBA *)

(** A `GdkRGBA` is used to represent a color, in a way that is compatible
with cairo’s notion of color.

`GdkRGBA` is a convenient way to pass colors around. It’s based on
cairo’s way to deal with colors and mirrors its behavior. All values
are in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. So the color
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) represents transparent black and
(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) is opaque white. Other values will
be clamped to this range when drawing. *)
type t = [`rgb_a] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Returns a textual specification of @rgba in the form
`rgb(r,g,b)` or `rgba(r,g,b,a)`, where “r”, “g”, “b” and
“a” represent the red, green, blue and alpha values
respectively. “r”, “g”, and “b” are represented as integers
in the range 0 to 255, and “a” is represented as a floating
point value in the range 0 to 1.

These string forms are string forms that are supported by
the CSS3 colors module, and can be parsed by [method@Gdk.RGBA.parse].

Note that this string representation may lose some precision,
since “r”, “g” and “b” are represented as 8-bit integers. If
this is a concern, you should use a different representation. *)
external to_string : t -> string = "ml_gdk_rgba_to_string"

(** Parses a textual representation of a color.

The string can be either one of:

- A standard name (Taken from the CSS specification).
- A hexadecimal value in the form “\#rgb”, “\#rrggbb”,
  “\#rrrgggbbb” or ”\#rrrrggggbbbb”
- A hexadecimal value in the form “\#rgba”, “\#rrggbbaa”,
  or ”\#rrrrggggbbbbaaaa”
- A RGB color in the form “rgb(r,g,b)” (In this case the color
  will have full opacity)
- A RGBA color in the form “rgba(r,g,b,a)”
- A HSL color in the form "hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)"
- A HSLA color in the form "hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)"

Where “r”, “g”, “b” and “a” are respectively the red, green,
blue and alpha color values. In the last two cases, “r”, “g”,
and “b” are either integers in the range 0 to 255 or percentage
values in the range 0% to 100%, and a is a floating point value
in the range 0 to 1. *)

(** Checks if an @rgba value is opaque.

That is, drawing with the value will not retain any results
from previous contents. *)

(** Checks if an @rgba value is transparent.

That is, drawing with the value would not produce any change. *)

(** A hash function suitable for using for a hash
table that stores `GdkRGBA`s. *)
external hash : t -> int = "ml_gdk_rgba_hash"

(** Frees a `GdkRGBA`. *)
external free : t -> unit = "ml_gdk_rgba_free"

(** Compares two `GdkRGBA` colors. *)
external equal : t -> t -> bool = "ml_gdk_rgba_equal"

(** Makes a copy of a `GdkRGBA`.

The result must be freed through [method@Gdk.RGBA.free]. *)
