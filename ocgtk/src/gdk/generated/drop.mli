(* Drop: Drop *)

type t = [`drop | `object_] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Selects all actions that are potentially supported by the destination.

When calling this function, do not restrict the passed in actions to
the ones provided by [method@Gdk.Drop.get_actions]. Those actions may
change in the future, even depending on the actions you provide here.

The @preferred action is a hint to the drag-and-drop mechanism about which
action to use when multiple actions are possible.

This function should be called by drag destinations in response to
%GDK_DRAG_ENTER or %GDK_DRAG_MOTION events. If the destination does
not yet know the exact actions it supports, it should set any possible
actions first and then later call this function again. *)
external status : t -> Gdk_enums.dragaction -> Gdk_enums.dragaction -> unit = "ml_gdk_drop_status"

(** Returns the `GdkSurface` performing the drop. *)
external get_surface : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Surface.t = "ml_gdk_drop_get_surface"

(** Returns the `GdkContentFormats` that the drop offers the data
to be read in. *)
external get_formats : t -> Content_formats.t = "ml_gdk_drop_get_formats"

(** If this is an in-app drag-and-drop operation, returns the `GdkDrag`
that corresponds to this drop.

If it is not, %NULL is returned. *)
external get_drag : t -> Drag.t option = "ml_gdk_drop_get_drag"

(** Gets the `GdkDisplay` that @self was created for. *)
external get_display : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Display.t = "ml_gdk_drop_get_display"

(** Returns the `GdkDevice` performing the drop. *)
external get_device : t -> App_launch_context_and__cairo_context_and__clipboard_and__device_and__display_and__draw_context_and__event_and__gl_context_and__monitor_and__seat_and__surface_and__vulkan_context.Device.t = "ml_gdk_drop_get_device"

(** Returns the possible actions for this `GdkDrop`.

If this value contains multiple actions - i.e.
[func@Gdk.DragAction.is_unique] returns %FALSE for the result -
[method@Gdk.Drop.finish] must choose the action to use when
accepting the drop. This will only happen if you passed
%GDK_ACTION_ASK as one of the possible actions in
[method@Gdk.Drop.status]. %GDK_ACTION_ASK itself will not
be included in the actions returned by this function.

This value may change over the lifetime of the [class@Gdk.Drop]
both as a response to source side actions as well as to calls to
[method@Gdk.Drop.status] or [method@Gdk.Drop.finish]. The source
side will not change this value anymore once a drop has started. *)
external get_actions : t -> Gdk_enums.dragaction = "ml_gdk_drop_get_actions"

(** Ends the drag operation after a drop.

The @action must be a single action selected from the actions
available via [method@Gdk.Drop.get_actions]. *)
external finish : t -> Gdk_enums.dragaction -> unit = "ml_gdk_drop_finish"
