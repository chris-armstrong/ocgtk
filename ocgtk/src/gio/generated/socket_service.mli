type t = [ `socket_service | `socket_listener | `object_ ] Gobject.obj

external new_ : unit -> t = "ml_g_socket_service_new"
(** Create a new SocketService *)

(* Methods *)

external stop : t -> unit = "ml_g_socket_service_stop"
(** Stops the service, i.e. stops accepting connections from the added sockets
    when the mainloop runs.

    This call is thread-safe, so it may be called from a thread handling an
    incoming client request.

    Note that this only stops accepting new connections; it does not close the
    listening sockets, and you can call g_socket_service_start() again later to
    begin listening again. To close the listening sockets, call
    g_socket_listener_close(). (This will happen automatically when the
    #GSocketService is finalized.)

    This must be called before calling g_socket_listener_close() as the socket
    service will start accepting connections immediately when a new socket is
    added. *)

external start : t -> unit = "ml_g_socket_service_start"
(** Restarts the service, i.e. start accepting connections from the added
    sockets when the mainloop runs. This only needs to be called after the
    service has been stopped from g_socket_service_stop().

    This call is thread-safe, so it may be called from a thread handling an
    incoming client request. *)

external is_active : t -> bool = "ml_g_socket_service_is_active"
(** Check whether the service is active or not. An active service will accept
    new clients that connect, while a non-active service will let connecting
    clients queue up until the service is started. *)

(* Properties *)

external get_active : t -> bool = "ml_g_socket_service_get_active"
(** Get property: active *)

external set_active : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_g_socket_service_set_active"
(** Set property: active *)
