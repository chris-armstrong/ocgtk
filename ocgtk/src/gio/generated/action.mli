(* Methods *)

external get_state_type : t -> Gvariant_type.t option
  = "ml_g_action_get_state_type"
(** Queries the type of the state of @action.

If the action is stateful (e.g. created with
[ctor@Gio.SimpleAction.new_stateful]) then this function returns the
[type@GLib.VariantType] of the state.  This is the type of the initial value
given as the state. All calls to [method@Gio.Action.change_state] must give a
[type@GLib.Variant] of this type and [method@Gio.Action.get_state] will return a
[type@GLib.Variant] of the same type.

If the action is not stateful (e.g. created with [ctor@Gio.SimpleAction.new])
then this function will return `NULL`. In that case, [method@Gio.Action.get_state]
will return `NULL` and you must not call [method@Gio.Action.change_state]. *)

external get_state_hint : t -> Gvariant.t option = "ml_g_action_get_state_hint"
(** Requests a hint about the valid range of values for the state of
@action.

If `NULL` is returned it either means that the action is not stateful
or that there is no hint about the valid range of values for the
state of the action.

If a [type@GLib.Variant] array is returned then each item in the array is a
possible value for the state.  If a [type@GLib.Variant] pair (ie: two-tuple) is
returned then the tuple specifies the inclusive lower and upper bound
of valid values for the state.

In any case, the information is merely a hint.  It may be possible to
have a state value outside of the hinted range and setting a value
within the range may fail.

The return value (if non-`NULL`) should be freed with
[method@GLib.Variant.unref] when it is no longer required. *)

external get_state : t -> Gvariant.t option = "ml_g_action_get_state"
(** Queries the current state of @action.

If the action is not stateful then `NULL` will be returned.  If the
action is stateful then the type of the return value is the type
given by [method@Gio.Action.get_state_type].

The return value (if non-`NULL`) should be freed with
[method@GLib.Variant.unref] when it is no longer required. *)

external get_parameter_type : t -> Gvariant_type.t option
  = "ml_g_action_get_parameter_type"
(** Queries the type of the parameter that must be given when activating
@action.

When activating the action using [method@Gio.Action.activate], the
[type@GLib.Variant] given to that function must be of the type returned by
this function.

In the case that this function returns `NULL`, you must not give any
[type@GLib.Variant], but `NULL` instead. *)

external get_name : t -> string = "ml_g_action_get_name"
(** Queries the name of @action. *)

external get_enabled : t -> bool = "ml_g_action_get_enabled"
(** Checks if @action is currently enabled.

An action must be enabled in order to be activated or in order to
have its state changed from outside callers. *)

external change_state : t -> Gvariant.t -> unit = "ml_g_action_change_state"
(** Request for the state of @action to be changed to @value.

The action must be stateful and @value must be of the correct type.
See [method@Gio.Action.get_state_type].

This call merely requests a change.  The action may refuse to change
its state or may change its state to something other than @value.
See [method@Gio.Action.get_state_hint].

If the @value [type@GLib.Variant] is floating, it is consumed. *)

external activate : t -> Gvariant.t option -> unit = "ml_g_action_activate"
(** Activates the action.

@parameter must be the correct type of parameter for the action (ie:
the parameter type given at construction time).  If the parameter
type was `NULL` then @parameter must also be `NULL`.

If the @parameter [type@GLib.Variant] is floating, it is consumed. *)
