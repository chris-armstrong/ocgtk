(* Methods *)

external list_actions : t -> string array = "ml_g_action_group_list_actions"
(** Lists the actions contained within @action_group.

The caller is responsible for freeing the list with g_strfreev() when
it is no longer required. *)

external has_action : t -> string -> bool = "ml_g_action_group_has_action"
(** Checks if the named action exists within @action_group. *)

external get_action_state_type : t -> string -> Gvariant_type.t option
  = "ml_g_action_group_get_action_state_type"
(** Queries the type of the state of the named action within
@action_group.

If the action is stateful then this function returns the
#GVariantType of the state.  All calls to
g_action_group_change_action_state() must give a #GVariant of this
type and g_action_group_get_action_state() will return a #GVariant
of the same type.

If the action is not stateful then this function will return %NULL.
In that case, g_action_group_get_action_state() will return %NULL
and you must not call g_action_group_change_action_state().

The state type of a particular action will never change but it is
possible for an action to be removed and for a new action to be added
with the same name but a different state type. *)

external get_action_state_hint : t -> string -> Gvariant.t option
  = "ml_g_action_group_get_action_state_hint"
(** Requests a hint about the valid range of values for the state of the
named action within @action_group.

If %NULL is returned it either means that the action is not stateful
or that there is no hint about the valid range of values for the
state of the action.

If a #GVariant array is returned then each item in the array is a
possible value for the state.  If a #GVariant pair (ie: two-tuple) is
returned then the tuple specifies the inclusive lower and upper bound
of valid values for the state.

In any case, the information is merely a hint.  It may be possible to
have a state value outside of the hinted range and setting a value
within the range may fail.

The return value (if non-%NULL) should be freed with
g_variant_unref() when it is no longer required. *)

external get_action_state : t -> string -> Gvariant.t option
  = "ml_g_action_group_get_action_state"
(** Queries the current state of the named action within @action_group.

If the action is not stateful then %NULL will be returned.  If the
action is stateful then the type of the return value is the type
given by g_action_group_get_action_state_type().

The return value (if non-%NULL) should be freed with
g_variant_unref() when it is no longer required. *)

external get_action_parameter_type : t -> string -> Gvariant_type.t option
  = "ml_g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type"
(** Queries the type of the parameter that must be given when activating
the named action within @action_group.

When activating the action using g_action_group_activate_action(),
the #GVariant given to that function must be of the type returned
by this function.

In the case that this function returns %NULL, you must not give any
#GVariant, but %NULL instead.

The parameter type of a particular action will never change but it is
possible for an action to be removed and for a new action to be added
with the same name but a different parameter type. *)

external get_action_enabled : t -> string -> bool
  = "ml_g_action_group_get_action_enabled"
(** Checks if the named action within @action_group is currently enabled.

An action must be enabled in order to be activated or in order to
have its state changed from outside callers. *)

external change_action_state : t -> string -> Gvariant.t -> unit
  = "ml_g_action_group_change_action_state"
(** Request for the state of the named action within @action_group to be
changed to @value.

The action must be stateful and @value must be of the correct type.
See g_action_group_get_action_state_type().

This call merely requests a change.  The action may refuse to change
its state or may change its state to something other than @value.
See g_action_group_get_action_state_hint().

If the @value GVariant is floating, it is consumed. *)

external activate_action : t -> string -> Gvariant.t option -> unit
  = "ml_g_action_group_activate_action"
(** Activate the named action within @action_group.

If the action is expecting a parameter, then the correct type of
parameter must be given as @parameter.  If the action is expecting no
parameters then @parameter must be %NULL.  See
g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type().

If the #GActionGroup implementation supports asynchronous remote
activation over D-Bus, this call may return before the relevant
D-Bus traffic has been sent, or any replies have been received. In
order to block on such asynchronous activation calls,
g_dbus_connection_flush() should be called prior to the code, which
depends on the result of the action activation. Without flushing
the D-Bus connection, there is no guarantee that the action would
have been activated.

The following code which runs in a remote app instance, shows an
example of a "quit" action being activated on the primary app
instance over D-Bus. Here g_dbus_connection_flush() is called
before `exit()`. Without g_dbus_connection_flush(), the "quit" action
may fail to be activated on the primary instance.

|[<!-- language="C" -->
// call "quit" action on primary instance
g_action_group_activate_action (G_ACTION_GROUP (app), "quit", NULL);

// make sure the action is activated now
g_dbus_connection_flush (...);

g_debug ("application has been terminated. exiting.");

exit (0);
