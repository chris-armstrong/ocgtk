external new_ : Gio_enums.subprocessflags -> unit -> string -> unit -> t = "ml_g_subprocess_new"

(* Methods *)
(** Collects the result of a previous call to
g_subprocess_wait_async(). *)
external wait_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_subprocess_wait_finish"

(** Collects the result of a previous call to
g_subprocess_wait_check_async(). *)
external wait_check_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_subprocess_wait_check_finish"

(** Combines g_subprocess_wait() with g_spawn_check_wait_status(). *)
external wait_check : t -> Cancellable.t option -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_subprocess_wait_check"

(** Synchronously wait for the subprocess to terminate.

After the process terminates you can query its exit status with
functions such as g_subprocess_get_if_exited() and
g_subprocess_get_exit_status().

This function does not fail in the case of the subprocess having
abnormal termination.  See g_subprocess_wait_check() for that.

Cancelling @cancellable doesn't kill the subprocess.  Call
g_subprocess_force_exit() if it is desirable. *)
external wait : t -> Cancellable.t option -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_subprocess_wait"

(** Sends the UNIX signal @signal_num to the subprocess, if it is still
running.

This API is race-free.  If the subprocess has terminated, it will not
be signalled.

This API is not available on Windows. *)
external send_signal : t -> int -> unit = "ml_g_subprocess_send_signal"

(** Get the signal number that caused the subprocess to terminate, given
that it terminated due to a signal.

This is equivalent to the system WTERMSIG macro.

It is an error to call this function before g_subprocess_wait() and
unless g_subprocess_get_if_signaled() returned %TRUE. *)
external get_term_sig : t -> int = "ml_g_subprocess_get_term_sig"

(** Checks if the process was "successful".  A process is considered
successful if it exited cleanly with an exit status of 0, either by
way of the exit() system call or return from main().

It is an error to call this function before g_subprocess_wait() has
returned. *)
external get_successful : t -> bool = "ml_g_subprocess_get_successful"

(** Gets the #GInputStream from which to read the stdout output of
@subprocess.

The process must have been created with %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDOUT_PIPE,
otherwise %NULL will be returned. *)
external get_stdout_pipe : t -> Input_stream.t option = "ml_g_subprocess_get_stdout_pipe"

(** Gets the #GOutputStream that you can write to in order to give data
to the stdin of @subprocess.

The process must have been created with %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDIN_PIPE and
not %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDIN_INHERIT, otherwise %NULL will be returned. *)
external get_stdin_pipe : t -> Output_stream.t option = "ml_g_subprocess_get_stdin_pipe"

(** Gets the #GInputStream from which to read the stderr output of
@subprocess.

The process must have been created with %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDERR_PIPE,
otherwise %NULL will be returned. *)
external get_stderr_pipe : t -> Input_stream.t option = "ml_g_subprocess_get_stderr_pipe"

(** Gets the raw status code of the process, as from waitpid().

This value has no particular meaning, but it can be used with the
macros defined by the system headers such as WIFEXITED.  It can also
be used with g_spawn_check_wait_status().

It is more likely that you want to use g_subprocess_get_if_exited()
followed by g_subprocess_get_exit_status().

It is an error to call this function before g_subprocess_wait() has
returned. *)
external get_status : t -> int = "ml_g_subprocess_get_status"

(** Check if the given subprocess terminated in response to a signal.

This is equivalent to the system WIFSIGNALED macro.

It is an error to call this function before g_subprocess_wait() has
returned. *)
external get_if_signaled : t -> bool = "ml_g_subprocess_get_if_signaled"

(** Check if the given subprocess exited normally (ie: by way of exit()
or return from main()).

This is equivalent to the system WIFEXITED macro.

It is an error to call this function before g_subprocess_wait() has
returned. *)
external get_if_exited : t -> bool = "ml_g_subprocess_get_if_exited"

(** On UNIX, returns the process ID as a decimal string.
On Windows, returns the result of GetProcessId() also as a string.
If the subprocess has terminated, this will return %NULL. *)
external get_identifier : t -> string option = "ml_g_subprocess_get_identifier"

(** Check the exit status of the subprocess, given that it exited
normally.  This is the value passed to the exit() system call or the
return value from main.

This is equivalent to the system WEXITSTATUS macro.

It is an error to call this function before g_subprocess_wait() and
unless g_subprocess_get_if_exited() returned %TRUE. *)
external get_exit_status : t -> int = "ml_g_subprocess_get_exit_status"

(** Use an operating-system specific method to attempt an immediate,
forceful termination of the process.  There is no mechanism to
determine whether or not the request itself was successful;
however, you can use g_subprocess_wait() to monitor the status of
the process after calling this function.

On Unix, this function sends %SIGKILL. *)
external force_exit : t -> unit = "ml_g_subprocess_force_exit"

(** Complete an invocation of g_subprocess_communicate_utf8_async(). *)
external communicate_utf8_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (bool * string option * string option, GError.t) result = "ml_g_subprocess_communicate_utf8_finish"

(** Like g_subprocess_communicate(), but validates the output of the
process as UTF-8, and returns it as a regular NUL terminated string.

On error, @stdout_buf and @stderr_buf will be set to undefined values and
should not be used. *)
external communicate_utf8 : t -> string option -> Cancellable.t option -> (bool * string option * string option, GError.t) result = "ml_g_subprocess_communicate_utf8"
