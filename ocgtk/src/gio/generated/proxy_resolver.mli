type t = [`proxy_resolver] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Call this function to obtain the array of proxy URIs when
g_proxy_resolver_lookup_async() is complete. See
g_proxy_resolver_lookup() for more details. *)
external lookup_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (string array, GError.t) result = "ml_g_proxy_resolver_lookup_finish"

(** Looks into the system proxy configuration to determine what proxy,
if any, to use to connect to @uri. The returned proxy URIs are of
the form `<protocol>://[user[:password]@]host[:port]` or
`direct://`, where <protocol> could be http, rtsp, socks
or other proxying protocol.

If you don't know what network protocol is being used on the
socket, you should use `none` as the URI protocol.
In this case, the resolver might still return a generic proxy type
(such as SOCKS), but would not return protocol-specific proxy types
(such as http).

`direct://` is used when no proxy is needed.
Direct connection should not be attempted unless it is part of the
returned array of proxies. *)
external lookup : t -> string -> Cancellable.t option -> (string array, GError.t) result = "ml_g_proxy_resolver_lookup"

(** Checks if @resolver can be used on this system. (This is used
internally; g_proxy_resolver_get_default() will only return a proxy
resolver that returns %TRUE for this method.) *)
