external new_resizable : unit -> t = "ml_g_memory_output_stream_new_resizable"
(** Create a new MemoryOutputStream *)

(* Methods *)

external steal_as_bytes : t -> Glib_bytes.t
  = "ml_g_memory_output_stream_steal_as_bytes"
(** Returns data from the @ostream as a #GBytes. @ostream must be
closed before calling this function. *)

external get_size : t -> Gsize.t = "ml_g_memory_output_stream_get_size"
(** Gets the size of the currently allocated data area (available from
    g_memory_output_stream_get_data()).

    You probably don't want to use this function on resizable streams. See
    g_memory_output_stream_get_data_size() instead. For resizable streams the
    size returned by this function is an implementation detail and may be change
    at any time in response to operations on the stream.

    If the stream is fixed-sized (ie: no realloc was passed to
    g_memory_output_stream_new()) then this is the maximum size of the stream
    and further writes will return %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE.

    In any case, if you want the number of bytes currently written to the
    stream, use g_memory_output_stream_get_data_size(). *)

external get_data_size : t -> Gsize.t
  = "ml_g_memory_output_stream_get_data_size"
(** Returns the number of bytes from the start up to including the last byte
    written in the stream that has not been truncated away. *)
