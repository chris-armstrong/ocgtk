(* DatagramBasedInterface: DatagramBasedInterface *)

(** Provides an interface for socket-like objects which have datagram semantics,
following the Berkeley sockets API. The interface methods are thin wrappers
around the corresponding virtual methods, and no pre-processing of inputs is
implemented — so implementations of this API must handle all functionality
documented in the interface methods. *)
