(** Unsubscribes from signals.

Note that there may still be D-Bus traffic to process (relating to this
signal subscription) in the current thread-default #GMainContext after this
function has returned. You should continue to iterate the #GMainContext
until the #GDestroyNotify function passed to
g_dbus_connection_signal_subscribe() is called, in order to avoid memory
leaks through callbacks queued on the #GMainContext after it’s stopped being
iterated.
Alternatively, any idle source with a priority lower than %G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
that was scheduled after unsubscription, also indicates that all resources
of this subscription are released. *)

(** Sets whether the process should be terminated when @connection is
closed by the remote peer. See #GDBusConnection:exit-on-close for
more details.

Note that this function should be used with care. Most modern UNIX
desktops tie the notion of a user session with the session bus, and expect
all of a user's applications to quit when their bus connection goes away.
If you are setting @exit_on_close to %FALSE for the shared session
bus connection, you should make sure that your application exits
when the user session ends. *)

(** Synchronously sends @message to the peer represented by @connection
and blocks the calling thread until a reply is received or the
timeout is reached. See g_dbus_connection_send_message_with_reply()
for the asynchronous version of this method.

Unless @flags contain the
%G_DBUS_SEND_MESSAGE_FLAGS_PRESERVE_SERIAL flag, the serial number
will be assigned by @connection and set on @message via
g_dbus_message_set_serial(). If @out_serial is not %NULL, then the
serial number used will be written to this location prior to
submitting the message to the underlying transport. While it has a `volatile`
qualifier, this is a historical artifact and the argument passed to it should
not be `volatile`.

If @connection is closed then the operation will fail with
%G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED. If @cancellable is canceled, the operation will
fail with %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED. If @message is not well-formed,
the operation fails with %G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT.

Note that @error is only set if a local in-process error
occurred. That is to say that the returned #GDBusMessage object may
be of type %G_DBUS_MESSAGE_TYPE_ERROR. Use
g_dbus_message_to_gerror() to transcode this to a #GError.

See this [server][gdbus-server] and [client][gdbus-unix-fd-client]
for an example of how to use this low-level API to send and receive
UNIX file descriptors.

Note that @message must be unlocked, unless @flags contain the

(** Removes a filter.

Note that since filters run in a different thread, there is a race
condition where it is possible that the filter will be running even
after calling g_dbus_connection_remove_filter(), so you cannot just
free data that the filter might be using. Instead, you should pass
a #GDestroyNotify to g_dbus_connection_add_filter(), which will be
called when it is guaranteed that the data is no longer needed. *)

stream from a worker thread, so it is not safe to interact with
the stream directly. *)

(** Gets the credentials of the authenticated peer. This will always
return %NULL unless @connection acted as a server
(e.g. %G_DBUS_CONNECTION_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATION_SERVER was passed)
when set up and the client passed credentials as part of the
authentication process.

In a message bus setup, the message bus is always the server and
each application is a client. So this method will always return
%NULL for message bus clients. *)

(** Retrieves the last serial number assigned to a #GDBusMessage on
the current thread. This includes messages sent via both low-level

(** Synchronously flushes @connection. The calling thread is blocked

does. *)

(** Exports @menu on @connection at @object_path.

The implemented D-Bus API should be considered private.
It is subject to change in the future.

An object path can only have one menu model exported on it. If this
constraint is violated, the export will fail and 0 will be
returned (with @error set accordingly).

Exporting menus with sections containing more than
%G_MENU_EXPORTER_MAX_SECTION_SIZE items is not supported and results in
undefined behavior.

You can unexport the menu model using
g_dbus_connection_unexport_menu_model() with the return value of
this function. *)

(** Exports @action_group on @connection at @object_path.

The implemented D-Bus API should be considered private.  It is
subject to change in the future.

A given object path can only have one action group exported on it.
If this constraint is violated, the export will fail and 0 will be
returned (with @error set accordingly).

You can unexport the action group using
g_dbus_connection_unexport_action_group() with the return value of
this function.

The thread default main context is taken at the time of this call.
All incoming action activations and state change requests are
reported from this context.  Any changes on the action group that
cause it to emit signals must also come from this same context.
Since incoming action activations and state change requests are
rather likely to cause changes on the action group, this effectively
limits a given action group to being exported from only one main
context. *)
external export_action_group : t -> string -> Action_group.t -> (int, GError.t) result = "ml_g_dbus_connection_export_action_group"

(** Emits a signal.

If the parameters GVariant is floating, it is consumed.

This can only fail if @parameters is not compatible with the D-Bus protocol
(%G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT), or if @connection has been closed
(%G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED). *)

does. *)

(** Synchronously invokes the @method_name method on the
@interface_name D-Bus interface on the remote object at
@object_path owned by @bus_name.

If @connection is closed then the operation will fail with
%G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED. If @cancellable is canceled, the
operation will fail with %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED. If @parameters
contains a value not compatible with the D-Bus protocol, the operation
fails with %G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT.

If @reply_type is non-%NULL then the reply will be checked for having
this type and an error will be raised if it does not match.  Said
another way, if you give a @reply_type then any non-%NULL return
value will be of this type.

If the @parameters #GVariant is floating, it is consumed.
This allows convenient 'inline' use of g_variant_new(), e.g.:

 g_dbus_connection_call_sync (connection,
                              "org.freedesktop.StringThings",

                              "TwoStrings",
                              g_variant_new ("(ss)",
                                             "Thing One",
