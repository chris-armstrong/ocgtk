(** Like g_dbus_method_invocation_return_value() but also takes a #GUnixFDList.

This method is only available on UNIX.

This method will take ownership of @invocation. See

@invocation. *)

(** Finishes handling a D-Bus method call by returning @parameters.
If the @parameters GVariant is floating, it is consumed.

It is an error if @parameters is not of the right format: it must be a tuple
containing the out-parameters of the D-Bus method. Even if the method has a
single out-parameter, it must be contained in a tuple. If the method has no
out-parameters, @parameters may be %NULL or an empty tuple.

This method will take ownership of @invocation. See
#GDBusInterfaceVTable for more information about the ownership of
@invocation.

Since 2.48, if the method call requested for a reply not to be sent
then this call will sink @parameters and free @invocation, but
otherwise do nothing (as per the recommendations of the D-Bus
specification). *)

handler for an object on account of its property_get() or
