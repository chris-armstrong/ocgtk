(* Methods *)

(** Sets the object path for @object. *)

external remove_interface_by_name : t -> string -> unit
  = "ml_g_dbus_object_skeleton_remove_interface_by_name"
(** Removes the #GDBusInterface with @interface_name from @object.

If no D-Bus interface of the given interface exists, this function
does nothing. *)

external remove_interface : t -> D_bus_interface_skeleton.t -> unit
  = "ml_g_dbus_object_skeleton_remove_interface"
(** Removes @interface_ from @object. *)

external flush : t -> unit = "ml_g_dbus_object_skeleton_flush"
(** This method simply calls g_dbus_interface_skeleton_flush() on all
interfaces belonging to @object. See that method for when flushing
is useful. *)

external add_interface : t -> D_bus_interface_skeleton.t -> unit
  = "ml_g_dbus_object_skeleton_add_interface"
(** Adds @interface_ to @object.

If @object already contains a #GDBusInterfaceSkeleton with the same
interface name, it is removed before @interface_ is added.

Note that @object takes its own reference on @interface_ and holds
it until removed. *)
