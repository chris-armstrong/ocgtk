  = "ml_g_menu_item_set_submenu"
(** Sets or unsets the "submenu" link of @menu_item to @submenu.

If @submenu is non-%NULL, it is linked to.  If it is %NULL then the
link is unset.

The effect of having one menu appear as a submenu of another is
exactly as it sounds. *)

external set_section :
  t -> Menu_link_iter_and__menu_model.Menu_model.t option -> unit
  = "ml_g_menu_item_set_section"
(** Sets or unsets the "section" link of @menu_item to @section.

The effect of having one menu appear as a section of another is
exactly as it sounds: the items from @section become a direct part of
the menu that @menu_item is added to.  See g_menu_item_new_section()
for more information about what it means for a menu item to be a
section. *)

external set_link :
  t -> string -> Menu_link_iter_and__menu_model.Menu_model.t option -> unit
  = "ml_g_menu_item_set_link"
(** Creates a link from @menu_item to @model if non-%NULL, or unsets it.

Links are used to establish a relationship between a particular menu
item and another menu.  For example, %G_MENU_LINK_SUBMENU is used to
associate a submenu with a particular menu item, and %G_MENU_LINK_SECTION
is used to create a section. Other types of link can be used, but there
is no guarantee that clients will be able to make sense of them.
Link types are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers
and '-'. Furthermore, the names must begin with a lowercase character,
must not end with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes. *)

external set_label : t -> string option -> unit = "ml_g_menu_item_set_label"
(** Sets or unsets the "label" attribute of @menu_item.

If @label is non-%NULL it is used as the label for the menu item.  If
it is %NULL then the label attribute is unset. *)

external set_icon : t -> Icon.t -> unit = "ml_g_menu_item_set_icon"
(** Sets (or unsets) the icon on @menu_item.

This call is the same as calling g_icon_serialize() and using the
result as the value to g_menu_item_set_attribute_value() for
%G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ICON.

This API is only intended for use with "noun" menu items; things like
bookmarks or applications in an "Open With" menu.  Don't use it on
menu items corresponding to verbs (eg: stock icons for 'Save' or
'Quit').

If @icon is %NULL then the icon is unset. *)

external set_detailed_action : t -> string -> unit
  = "ml_g_menu_item_set_detailed_action"
(** Sets the "action" and possibly the "target" attribute of @menu_item.

The format of @detailed_action is the same format parsed by
g_action_parse_detailed_name().

See g_menu_item_set_action_and_target() or
g_menu_item_set_action_and_target_value() for more flexible (but
slightly less convenient) alternatives.

See also g_menu_item_set_action_and_target_value() for a description of
the semantics of the action and target attributes. *)

external set_attribute_value : t -> string -> Gvariant.t option -> unit
  = "ml_g_menu_item_set_attribute_value"
(** Sets or unsets an attribute on @menu_item.

The attribute to set or unset is specified by @attribute. This
can be one of the standard attribute names %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_LABEL,
%G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION, %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_TARGET, or a custom
attribute name.
Attribute names are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers
and '-'. Furthermore, the names must begin with a lowercase character,
must not end with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.

must consist only of lowercase
ASCII characters, digits and '-'.

If @value is non-%NULL then it is used as the new value for the
attribute.  If @value is %NULL then the attribute is unset. If
the @value #GVariant is floating, it is consumed.

See also g_menu_item_set_attribute() for a more convenient way to do
the same. *)

external set_action_and_target_value :
  t -> string option -> Gvariant.t option -> unit
  = "ml_g_menu_item_set_action_and_target_value"
(** Sets or unsets the "action" and "target" attributes of @menu_item.

If @action is %NULL then both the "action" and "target" attributes
are unset (and @target_value is ignored).

If @action is non-%NULL then the "action" attribute is set.  The
"target" attribute is then set to the value of @target_value if it is
non-%NULL or unset otherwise.

Normal menu items (ie: not submenu, section or other custom item
types) are expected to have the "action" attribute set to identify
the action that they are associated with.  The state type of the
action help to determine the disposition of the menu item.  See
#GAction and #GActionGroup for an overview of actions.

In general, clicking on the menu item will result in activation of
the named action with the "target" attribute given as the parameter
to the action invocation.  If the "target" attribute is not set then
the action is invoked with no parameter.

If the action has no state then the menu item is usually drawn as a
plain menu item (ie: with no additional decoration).

If the action has a boolean state then the menu item is usually drawn
as a toggle menu item (ie: with a checkmark or equivalent
indication).  The item should be marked as 'toggled' or 'checked'
when the boolean state is %TRUE.

If the action has a string state then the menu item is usually drawn
as a radio menu item (ie: with a radio bullet or equivalent
indication).  The item should be marked as 'selected' when the string
state is equal to the value of the @target property.

See g_menu_item_set_action_and_target() or
g_menu_item_set_detailed_action() for two equivalent calls that are
probably more convenient for most uses. *)

external get_link :

(** Queries the named @attribute on @menu_item.

If @expected_type is specified and the attribute does not have this
type, %NULL is returned.  %NULL is also returned if the attribute
simply does not exist. *)
