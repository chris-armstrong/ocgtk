(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings or for @value to have the incorrect type, per
the schema.

If @value is floating then this function consumes the reference. *)

external set_uint64 : t -> string -> UInt64.t -> bool
  = "ml_g_settings_set_uint64"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for 64-bit unsigned
integers.

external set_strv : t -> string -> string array option -> bool
  = "ml_g_settings_set_strv"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for string arrays.  If
@value is %NULL, then @key is set to be the empty array.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having an array of strings type in the schema for @settings. *)

external set_string : t -> string -> string -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_string"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for strings.

having a string type in the schema for @settings. *)

external set_int64 : t -> string -> int64 -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_int64"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for 64-bit integers.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a int64 type in the schema for @settings. *)

external set_int : t -> string -> int -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_int"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for 32-bit integers.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a int32 type in the schema for @settings. *)

external set_flags : t -> string -> int -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_flags"
(** Looks up the flags type nicks for the bits specified by @value, puts
them in an array of strings and writes the array to @key, within
@settings.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings or is not marked as a flags type, or for @value
to contain any bits that are not value for the named type.

After performing the write, accessing @key directly with
g_settings_get_strv() will return an array of 'nicks'; one for each
bit in @value. *)

external set_enum : t -> string -> int -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_enum"
(** Looks up the enumerated type nick for @value and writes it to @key,
within @settings.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings or is not marked as an enumerated type, or for
@value not to be a valid value for the named type.

After performing the write, accessing @key directly with
g_settings_get_string() will return the 'nick' associated with
@value. *)

external set_double : t -> string -> float -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_double"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for doubles.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a 'double' type in the schema for @settings. *)

external set_boolean : t -> string -> bool -> bool = "ml_g_settings_set_boolean"
(** Sets @key in @settings to @value.

A convenience variant of g_settings_set() for booleans.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a boolean type in the schema for @settings. *)

external revert : t -> unit = "ml_g_settings_revert"
(** Reverts all non-applied changes to the settings.  This function
does nothing unless @settings is in 'delay-apply' mode; see
g_settings_delay().  In the normal case settings are always applied
immediately.

Change notifications will be emitted for affected keys. *)

external reset : t -> string -> unit = "ml_g_settings_reset"
(** Resets @key to its default value.

This call resets the key, as much as possible, to its default value.
That might be the value specified in the schema or the one set by the
administrator. *)

external range_check : t -> string -> Gvariant.t -> bool
  = "ml_g_settings_range_check"
(** Checks if the given @value is of the correct type and within the
permitted range for @key. *)

external list_keys : t -> string array = "ml_g_settings_list_keys"
(** Introspects the list of keys on @settings.

You should probably not be calling this function from "normal" code
(since you should already know what keys are in your schema).  This
function is intended for introspection reasons.

You should free the return value with g_strfreev() when you are done
with it. *)

external list_children : t -> string array = "ml_g_settings_list_children"
(** Gets the list of children on @settings.

The list is exactly the list of strings for which it is not an error
to call g_settings_get_child().

There is little reason to call this function from "normal" code, since
you should already know what children are in your schema. This function
may still be useful there for introspection reasons, however.

You should free the return value with g_strfreev() when you are done
with it. *)

(** Finds out if a key can be written or not *)

external get_value : t -> string -> Gvariant.t = "ml_g_settings_get_value"
(** Gets the value that is stored in @settings for @key.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings. *)

external get_user_value : t -> string -> Gvariant.t option
  = "ml_g_settings_get_user_value"
(** Checks the "user value" of a key, if there is one.

The user value of a key is the last value that was set by the user.

After calling g_settings_reset() this function should always return
%NULL (assuming something is not wrong with the system
configuration).

It is possible that g_settings_get_value() will return a different
value than this function.  This can happen in the case that the user
set a value for a key that was subsequently locked down by the system
administrator -- this function will return the user's old value.

This function may be useful for adding a "reset" option to a UI or
for providing indication that a particular value has been changed.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings. *)

external get_uint64 : t -> string -> UInt64.t = "ml_g_settings_get_uint64"
(** Gets the value that is stored at @key in @settings.

A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for 32-bit unsigned
integers.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a uint32 type in the schema for @settings. *)

external get_strv : t -> string -> string array = "ml_g_settings_get_strv"
(** A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for string arrays.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having an array of strings type in the schema for @settings. *)

external get_string : t -> string -> string = "ml_g_settings_get_string"
(** Gets the value that is stored at @key in @settings.

A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for strings.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a string type in the schema for @settings. *)

external get_range : t -> string -> Gvariant.t = "ml_g_settings_get_range"
(** Queries the range of a key. *)

external get_int64 : t -> string -> int64 = "ml_g_settings_get_int64"
(** Gets the value that is stored at @key in @settings.

A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for 64-bit integers.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a int64 type in the schema for @settings. *)

external get_int : t -> string -> int = "ml_g_settings_get_int"
(** Gets the value that is stored at @key in @settings.

A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for 32-bit integers.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a int32 type in the schema for @settings. *)

external get_has_unapplied : t -> bool = "ml_g_settings_get_has_unapplied"
(** Returns whether the #GSettings object has any unapplied changes. This can
    only be the case if it is in 'delayed-apply' mode. *)

external get_flags : t -> string -> int = "ml_g_settings_get_flags"
(** Gets the value that is stored in @settings for @key and converts it
to the flags value that it represents.

In order to use this function the type of the value must be an array
of strings and it must be marked in the schema file as a flags type.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings or is not marked as a flags type.

If the value stored in the configuration database is not a valid
value for the flags type then this function will return the default
value. *)

external get_enum : t -> string -> int = "ml_g_settings_get_enum"
(** Gets the value that is stored in @settings for @key and converts it
to the enum value that it represents.

In order to use this function the type of the value must be a string
and it must be marked in the schema file as an enumerated type.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings or is not marked as an enumerated type.

If the value stored in the configuration database is not a valid
value for the enumerated type then this function will return the
default value. *)

external get_double : t -> string -> float = "ml_g_settings_get_double"
(** Gets the value that is stored at @key in @settings.

A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for doubles.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a 'double' type in the schema for @settings. *)

external get_default_value : t -> string -> Gvariant.t option
  = "ml_g_settings_get_default_value"
(** Gets the "default value" of a key.

This is the value that would be read if g_settings_reset() were to be
called on the key.

Note that this may be a different value than returned by
g_settings_schema_key_get_default_value() if the system administrator
has provided a default value.

Comparing the return values of g_settings_get_default_value() and
g_settings_get_value() is not sufficient for determining if a value
has been set because the user may have explicitly set the value to
something that happens to be equal to the default.  The difference
here is that if the default changes in the future, the user's key
will still be set.

This function may be useful for adding an indication to a UI of what
the default value was before the user set it.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't contained in the
schema for @settings. *)

external get_child : t -> string -> t = "ml_g_settings_get_child"
(** Creates a child settings object which has a base path of
`base-path/@name`, where `base-path` is the base path of
@settings.

The schema for the child settings object must have been declared
in the schema of @settings using a `<child>` element.

The created child settings object will inherit the #GSettings:delay-apply
mode from @settings. *)

external get_boolean : t -> string -> bool = "ml_g_settings_get_boolean"
(** Gets the value that is stored at @key in @settings.

A convenience variant of g_settings_get() for booleans.

It is a programmer error to give a @key that isn't specified as
having a boolean type in the schema for @settings. *)

external delay : t -> unit = "ml_g_settings_delay"
(** Changes the #GSettings object into 'delay-apply' mode. In this
mode, changes to @settings are not immediately propagated to the
backend, but kept locally until g_settings_apply() is called. *)

external create_action : t -> string -> Action.t = "ml_g_settings_create_action"
(** Creates a #GAction corresponding to a given #GSettings key.

    The action has the same name as the key.

    The value of the key becomes the state of the action and the action is
    enabled when the key is writable. Changing the state of the action results
    in the key being written to. Changes to the value or writability of the key
    cause appropriate change notifications to be emitted for the action.

    For boolean-valued keys, action activations take no parameter and result in
    the toggling of the value. For all other types, activations take the new
    value for the key (which must have the correct type). *)

external bind_writable :
  t -> string -> [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj -> string -> bool -> unit
  = "ml_g_settings_bind_writable"
(** Create a binding between the writability of @key in the
@settings object and the property @property of @object.
The property must be boolean; "sensitive" or "visible"
properties of widgets are the most likely candidates.

Writable bindings are always uni-directional; changes of the
writability of the setting will be propagated to the object
property, not the other way.

When the @inverted argument is %TRUE, the binding inverts the
value as it passes from the setting to the object, i.e. @property
will be set to %TRUE if the key is not writable.

Note that the lifecycle of the binding is tied to @object,
and that you can have only one binding per object property.
If you bind the same property twice on the same object, the second
binding overrides the first one. *)

external bind :
  t ->
  string ->
  [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj ->
  string ->
  Gio_enums.settingsbindflags ->
  unit = "ml_g_settings_bind"
(** Create a binding between the @key in the @settings object
and the property @property of @object.

The binding uses the default GIO mapping functions to map
between the settings and property values. These functions
handle booleans, numeric types and string types in a
straightforward way. Use g_settings_bind_with_mapping() if
you need a custom mapping, or map between types that are not
supported by the default mapping functions.

Unless the @flags include %G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY, this
function also establishes a binding between the writability of
@key and the "sensitive" property of @object (if @object has
a boolean property by that name). See g_settings_bind_writable()
for more details about writable bindings.

Note that the lifecycle of the binding is tied to @object,
and that you can have only one binding per object property.
If you bind the same property twice on the same object, the second
binding overrides the first one. *)

external apply : t -> unit = "ml_g_settings_apply"
(** Applies any changes that have been made to the settings.  This
function does nothing unless @settings is in 'delay-apply' mode;
see g_settings_delay().  In the normal case settings are always
applied immediately. *)
