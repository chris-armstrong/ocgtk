(* Rect: Rect *)

(** The location and size of a rectangle region.

The width and height of a #graphene_rect_t can be negative; for instance,
a #graphene_rect_t with an origin of [ 0, 0 ] and a size of [ 10, 10 ] is
equivalent to a #graphene_rect_t with an origin of [ 10, 10 ] and a size
of [ -10, -10 ].

Application code can normalize rectangles using graphene_rect_normalize();
this function will ensure that the width and height of a rectangle are
positive values. All functions taking a #graphene_rect_t as an argument
will internally operate on a normalized copy; all functions returning a
#graphene_rect_t will always return a normalized rectangle. *)

(* Methods *)
(** Computes the union of the two given rectangles.

![](rectangle-union.png)

The union in the image above is the blue outline. *)
external union : t -> t -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_union"

(** Scales the size and origin of a rectangle horizontaly by @s_h,
and vertically by @s_v. The result @res is normalized. *)
external scale : t -> float -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_scale"

(** Rounds the origin and the size of the given rectangle to
their nearest integer values; the rounding is guaranteed
to be large enough to contain the original rectangle. *)
external round_to_pixel : t -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_round_to_pixel"

(** Rounds the origin of the given rectangle to its nearest
integer value and and recompute the size so that the
rectangle is large enough to contain all the conrners
of the original rectangle.

This function is the equivalent of calling `floor` on
the coordinates of the origin, and recomputing the size
calling `ceil` on the bottom-right coordinates.

If you want to be sure that the rounded rectangle
completely covers the area that was covered by the
original rectangle — i.e. you want to cover the area
including all its corners — this function will make sure
that the size is recomputed taking into account the ceiling
of the coordinates of the bottom-right corner.
If the difference between the original coordinates and the
coordinates of the rounded rectangle is greater than the
difference between the original size and and the rounded
size, then the move of the origin would not be compensated
by a move in the anti-origin, leaving the corners of the
original rectangle outside the rounded one. *)
external round_extents : t -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_round_extents"

(** Rounds the origin and size of the given rectangle to
their nearest integer values; the rounding is guaranteed
to be large enough to have an area bigger or equal to the
original rectangle, but might not fully contain its extents.
Use graphene_rect_round_extents() in case you need to round
to a rectangle that covers fully the original one.

This function is the equivalent of calling `floor` on
the coordinates of the origin, and `ceil` on the size. *)
external round : t -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_round"

(** Offsets the origin of the given rectangle by @d_x and @d_y.

The size of the rectangle is left unchanged. *)
external offset_r : t -> float -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_offset_r"

(** Offsets the origin by @d_x and @d_y.

The size of the rectangle is unchanged. *)
external offset : t -> float -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_offset"

(** Normalizes the passed rectangle.

This function ensures that the size of the rectangle is made of
positive values, and that the origin is in the top-left corner
of the rectangle. *)
external normalize_r : t -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_normalize_r"

(** Normalizes the passed rectangle.

This function ensures that the size of the rectangle is made of
positive values, and that the origin is the top-left corner of
the rectangle. *)
external normalize : t -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_normalize"

(** Computes the intersection of the two given rectangles.

![](rectangle-intersection.png)

The intersection in the image above is the blue outline.

If the two rectangles do not intersect, @res will contain
a degenerate rectangle with origin in (0, 0) and a size of 0. *)
external intersection : t -> t -> bool * t = "ml_graphene_rect_intersection"

(** Linearly interpolates the origin and size of the two given
rectangles. *)
external interpolate : t -> t -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_interpolate"

(** Changes the given rectangle to be smaller, or larger depending on the
given inset parameters.

To create an inset rectangle, use positive @d_x or @d_y values; to
create a larger, encompassing rectangle, use negative @d_x or @d_y
values.

The origin of the rectangle is offset by @d_x and @d_y, while the size
is adjusted by `(2 * @d_x, 2 * @d_y)`. If @d_x and @d_y are positive
values, the size of the rectangle is decreased; if @d_x and @d_y are
negative values, the size of the rectangle is increased.

If the size of the resulting inset rectangle has a negative width or
height then the size will be set to zero. *)
external inset_r : t -> float -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_rect_inset_r"

(** Changes the given rectangle to be smaller, or larger depending on the
given inset parameters.

To create an inset rectangle, use positive @d_x or @d_y values; to
