(* Methods *)

external to_vec3 : t -> Vec3_and__vec4.Vec3.t = "ml_graphene_point3d_to_vec3"
(** Stores the coordinates of a #graphene_point3d_t into a #graphene_vec3_t. *)

external scale : t -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_point3d_scale"
(** Scales the coordinates of the given #graphene_point3d_t by
the given @factor. *)

external normalize_viewport : t -> Rect.t -> float -> float -> t
  = "ml_graphene_point3d_normalize_viewport"
(** Normalizes the coordinates of a #graphene_point3d_t using the given viewport
    and clipping planes.

    The coordinates of the resulting #graphene_point3d_t will be in the
    [ -1, 1 ] range. *)

(** Checks whether the two points are near each other, within
an @epsilon factor. *)

external length : t -> float = "ml_graphene_point3d_length"
(** Computes the length of the vector represented by the coordinates of the
    given #graphene_point3d_t. *)

external interpolate : t -> t -> float -> t = "ml_graphene_point3d_interpolate"
(** Linearly interpolates each component of @a and @b using the
provided @factor, and places the result in @res. *)

external init_from_vec3 : t -> Vec3_and__vec4.Vec3.t -> t
  = "ml_graphene_point3d_init_from_vec3"
(** Initializes a #graphene_point3d_t using the components of a
