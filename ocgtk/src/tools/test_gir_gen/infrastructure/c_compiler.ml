(** OCaml-configured C compiler discovery.

    Pipeline tests that compile C code must invoke the same C compiler the OCaml
    toolchain was built with, rather than a hard-coded [cc] or [gcc]. This keeps
    tests portable to FreeBSD and macOS where [gcc] may not exist or may be a
    clang shim with different flags.

    See [docs/plans/test-suite-remediation.md] § Phase 1.5 for the principle. *)
