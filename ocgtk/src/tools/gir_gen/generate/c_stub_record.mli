(** C Stub Code Generation - Record Support *)

val has_copy_method : Types.gir_record -> bool
(** [has_copy_method record] checks if a record has a copy method, indicating
    it's a value-like record that should be stack-allocated in C but
    heap-allocated in OCaml. *)

val is_value_like_record : Types.gir_record -> bool
(** [is_value_like_record record] determines if a record is value-like, meaning
    it is non-opaque and has a copy method. *)

val generate_forward_decls :
  namespace_prefix:string -> records:Types.gir_record list -> string
(** [generate_forward_decls ~records] generates C forward declarations and
    macros for record converters. Handles both value-like records (with copy
    methods) and non-value-like records. *)

val generate_record_converters :
  namespace_prefix:string -> buf:Buffer.t -> Types.gir_record -> unit
(** [generate_record_converters ~buf record] generates conversion functions for
    a record, writing the C code to the provided buffer. Handles both opaque and
    value-like records. *)

val generate_record_c_code :
  ctx:Types.generation_context -> Types.gir_record -> string
(** [generate_record_c_code ~ctx record] generates the complete C code for a
    record, including conversion functions, constructors, and methods. *)
