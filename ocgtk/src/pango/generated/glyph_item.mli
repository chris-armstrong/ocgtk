(* GlyphItem: GlyphItem *)

(** A `PangoGlyphItem` is a pair of a `PangoItem` and the glyphs
resulting from shaping the items text.

As an example of the usage of `PangoGlyphItem`, the results
of shaping text with `PangoLayout` is a list of `PangoLayoutLine`,
each of which contains a list of `PangoGlyphItem`. *)
type t = [`glyph_item] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Modifies @orig to cover only the text after @split_index, and
returns a new item that covers the text before @split_index that
used to be in @orig.

You can think of @split_index as the length of the returned item.
@split_index may not be 0, and it may not be greater than or equal
to the length of @orig (that is, there must be at least one byte
assigned to each item, you can't create a zero-length item).

This function is similar in function to pango_item_split() (and uses
it internally.) *)
external split : t -> string -> int -> t option = "ml_pango_glyph_item_split"

(** Frees a `PangoGlyphItem` and resources to which it points. *)
external free : t -> unit = "ml_pango_glyph_item_free"

(** Make a deep copy of an existing `PangoGlyphItem` structure. *)
external copy : t -> t option = "ml_pango_glyph_item_copy"

(** Splits a shaped item (`PangoGlyphItem`) into multiple items based
on an attribute list.

The idea is that if you have attributes that don't affect shaping,
such as color or underline, to avoid affecting shaping, you filter
them out ([method@Pango.AttrList.filter]), apply the shaping process
and then reapply them to the result using this function.

All attributes that start or end inside a cluster are applied
to that cluster; for instance, if half of a cluster is underlined
and the other-half strikethrough, then the cluster will end
up with both underline and strikethrough attributes. In these
cases, it may happen that @item->extra_attrs for some of the
result items can have multiple attributes of the same type.

This function takes ownership of @glyph_item; it will be reused
as one of the elements in the list. *)
external apply_attrs : t -> string -> Attr_list.t -> t list = "ml_pango_glyph_item_apply_attrs"
