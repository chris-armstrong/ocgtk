(* Item: Item *)

type t = [ `item ] Gobject.obj
(** The `PangoItem` structure stores information about a segment of text.

    You typically obtain `PangoItems` by itemizing a piece of text with
    [func@itemize]. *)

external new_ : unit -> t = "ml_pango_item_new"
(** Create a new Item *)

(* Methods *)

external split : t -> int -> int -> t = "ml_pango_item_split"
(** Modifies @orig to cover only the text after @split_index, and
returns a new item that covers the text before @split_index that
used to be in @orig.

You can think of @split_index as the length of the returned item.
@split_index may not be 0, and it may not be greater than or equal
to the length of @orig (that is, there must be at least one byte
assigned to each item, you can't create a zero-length item).
@split_offset is the length of the first item in chars, and must be
provided because the text used to generate the item isn't available,
so `pango_item_split()` can't count the char length of the split items
itself. *)

external free : t -> unit = "ml_pango_item_free"
(** Free a `PangoItem` and all associated memory. *)

external copy : t -> t option = "ml_pango_item_copy"
(** Copy an existing `PangoItem` structure. *)

external apply_attrs : t -> Attr_iterator.t -> unit
  = "ml_pango_item_apply_attrs"
(** Add attributes to a `PangoItem`.

The idea is that you have attributes that don't affect itemization,
such as font features, so you filter them out using
[method@Pango.AttrList.filter], itemize your text, then reapply the
attributes to the resulting items using this function.

The @iter should be positioned before the range of the item,
and will be advanced past it. This function is meant to be called
in a loop over the items resulting from itemization, while passing
the iter to each call. *)
