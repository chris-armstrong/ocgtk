type t = [ `language ] Gobject.obj
(** The `PangoLanguage` structure is used to represent a language.

    `PangoLanguage` pointers can be efficiently copied and compared with each
    other. *)

(* Methods *)

external to_string : t -> string = "ml_pango_language_to_string"
(** Gets the RFC-3066 format string representing the given language tag.

    Returns (transfer none): a string representing the language tag *)

external matches : t -> string -> bool = "ml_pango_language_matches"
(** Checks if a language tag matches one of the elements in a list of language
    ranges.

    A language tag is considered to match a range in the list if the range is
    '*', the range is exactly the tag, or the range is a prefix of the tag, and
    the character after it in the tag is '-'. *)

external includes_script : t -> Pango_enums.script -> bool
  = "ml_pango_language_includes_script"
(** Determines if @script is one of the scripts used to
write @language.

The returned value is conservative; if nothing is known about
the language tag @language, %TRUE will be returned, since, as
far as Pango knows, @script might be used to write @language.

This routine is used in Pango's itemization process when
determining if a supplied language tag is relevant to
a particular section of text. It probably is not useful
for applications in most circumstances.

This function uses [method@Pango.Language.get_scripts] internally. *)

external get_scripts : t -> Pango_enums.script array option * int
  = "ml_pango_language_get_scripts"
(** Determines the scripts used to to write @language.

If nothing is known about the language tag @language,
or if @language is %NULL, then %NULL is returned.
The list of scripts returned starts with the script that the
language uses most and continues to the one it uses least.

The value @num_script points at will be set to the number
of scripts in the returned array (or zero if %NULL is returned).

Most languages use only one script for writing, but there are
some that use two (Latin and Cyrillic for example), and a few
use three (Japanese for example). Applications should not make
any assumptions on the maximum number of scripts returned
though, except that it is positive if the return value is not
%NULL, and it is a small number.

The [method@Pango.Language.includes_script] function uses this
function internally.

Note: while the return value is declared as `PangoScript`, the
returned values are from the `GUnicodeScript` enumeration, which
may have more values. Callers need to handle unknown values. *)

external get_sample_string : t -> string = "ml_pango_language_get_sample_string"
(** Get a string that is representative of the characters needed to
render a particular language.

The sample text may be a pangram, but is not necessarily. It is chosen
to be demonstrative of normal text in the language, as well as exposing
font feature requirements unique to the language. It is suitable for use
as sample text in a font selection dialog.

If @language is %NULL, the default language as found by
[func@Pango.Language.get_default] is used.

If Pango does not have a sample string for @language, the classic
"The quick brown fox..." is returned.  This can be detected by
comparing the returned pointer value to that returned for (non-existent)
language code "xx".  That is, compare to:

```
pango_language_get_sample_string (pango_language_from_string ("xx"))
``` *)
