  (* Methods *)
  (** Converts from X and Y position within a layout to the byte index to the
  character at that logical position.

  If the Y position is not inside the layout, the closest position is
  chosen (the position will be clamped inside the layout). If the X position
  is not within the layout, then the start or the end of the line is
  chosen as described for [method@Pango.LayoutLine.x_to_index]. If either
  the X or Y positions were not inside the layout, then the function returns
  %FALSE; on an exact hit, it returns %TRUE. *)
  external xy_to_index : t -> int -> int -> bool * int * int = "ml_pango_layout_xy_to_index"

  (** A convenience method to serialize a layout to a file.

  It is equivalent to calling [method@Pango.Layout.serialize]
  followed by [func@GLib.file_set_contents].

  See those two functions for details on the arguments.

  It is mostly intended for use inside a debugger to quickly dump
  a layout to a file for later inspection. *)
  external write_to_file : t -> Pango_enums.layoutserializeflags -> string -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_pango_layout_write_to_file"

  (** Sets the wrap mode.

  The wrap mode only has effect if a width is set on the layout
  with [method@Pango.Layout.set_width]. To turn off wrapping,
  set the width to -1.

  The default value is %PANGO_WRAP_WORD. *)
  external set_wrap : t -> Pango_enums.wrapmode -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_wrap"

  (** Sets the width to which the lines of the `PangoLayout` should wrap or
  ellipsized.

  The default value is -1: no width set. *)
  external set_width : t -> int -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_width"

  (** Sets the text of the layout.

  This function validates @text and renders invalid UTF-8
  with a placeholder glyph.

  Note that if you have used [method@Pango.Layout.set_markup] or
  [method@Pango.Layout.set_markup_with_accel] on @layout before, you
  may want to call [method@Pango.Layout.set_attributes] to clear the
  attributes set on the layout from the markup as this function does
  not clear attributes. *)
  external set_text : t -> string -> int -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_text"

  (** Sets the tabs to use for @layout, overriding the default tabs.

  `PangoLayout` will place content at the next tab position
  whenever it meets a Tab character (U+0009).

  By default, tabs are every 8 spaces. If @tabs is %NULL, the
  default tabs are reinstated. @tabs is copied into the layout;
  you must free your copy of @tabs yourself.

  Note that tabs and justification conflict with each other:
  Justification will move content away from its tab-aligned
  positions. The same is true for alignments other than
  %PANGO_ALIGN_LEFT. *)
  external set_tabs : t -> Tab_array.t option -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_tabs"

  (** Sets the amount of spacing in Pango units between
  the lines of the layout.

  When placing lines with spacing, Pango arranges things so that

      line2.top = line1.bottom + spacing

  The default value is 0.

  Note: Since 1.44, Pango is using the line height (as determined
  by the font) for placing lines when the line spacing factor is set
  to a non-zero value with [method@Pango.Layout.set_line_spacing].
  In that case, the @spacing set with this function is ignored.

  Note: for semantics that are closer to the CSS line-height
  property, see [func@Pango.attr_line_height_new]. *)
  external set_spacing : t -> int -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_spacing"

  (** Sets the single paragraph mode of @layout.

  If @setting is %TRUE, do not treat newlines and similar characters
  as paragraph separators; instead, keep all text in a single paragraph,
  and display a glyph for paragraph separator characters. Used when
  you want to allow editing of newlines on a single text line.

  The default value is %FALSE. *)
  external set_single_paragraph_mode : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_single_paragraph_mode"

  (** Sets the layout text and attribute list from marked-up text.

  See [Pango Markup](pango_markup.html)).

  Replaces the current text and attribute list.

  This is the same as [method@Pango.Layout.set_markup_with_accel],
  but the markup text isn't scanned for accelerators. *)
  external set_markup : t -> string -> int -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_markup"

  (** Sets a factor for line spacing.

  Typical values are: 0, 1, 1.5, 2. The default values is 0.

  If @factor is non-zero, lines are placed so that

      baseline2 = baseline1 + factor * height2

  where height2 is the line height of the second line
  (as determined by the font(s)). In this case, the spacing
  set with [method@Pango.Layout.set_spacing] is ignored.

  If @factor is zero (the default), spacing is applied as before.

  Note: for semantics that are closer to the CSS line-height
  property, see [func@Pango.attr_line_height_new]. *)
  external set_line_spacing : t -> float -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_line_spacing"

  (** Sets whether the last line should be stretched to fill the
  entire width of the layout.

  This only has an effect if [method@Pango.Layout.set_justify] has
  been called as well.

  The default value is %FALSE. *)
  external set_justify_last_line : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_justify_last_line"

  (** Sets whether each complete line should be stretched to fill the
  entire width of the layout.

  Stretching is typically done by adding whitespace, but for some scripts
  (such as Arabic), the justification may be done in more complex ways,
  like extending the characters.

  Note that this setting is not implemented and so is ignored in
  Pango older than 1.18.

  Note that tabs and justification conflict with each other:
  Justification will move content away from its tab-aligned
  positions.

  The default value is %FALSE.

  Also see [method@Pango.Layout.set_justify_last_line]. *)
  external set_justify : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_justify"

  (** Sets the width in Pango units to indent each paragraph.

  A negative value of @indent will produce a hanging indentation.
  That is, the first line will have the full width, and subsequent
  lines will be indented by the absolute value of @indent.

  The indent setting is ignored if layout alignment is set to
  %PANGO_ALIGN_CENTER.

  The default value is 0. *)
  external set_indent : t -> int -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_indent"

  (** Sets the height to which the `PangoLayout` should be ellipsized at.

  There are two different behaviors, based on whether @height is positive
  or negative.

  If @height is positive, it will be the maximum height of the layout. Only
  lines would be shown that would fit, and if there is any text omitted,
  an ellipsis added. At least one line is included in each paragraph regardless
  of how small the height value is. A value of zero will render exactly one
  line for the entire layout.

  If @height is negative, it will be the (negative of) maximum number of lines
  per paragraph. That is, the total number of lines shown may well be more than
  this value if the layout contains multiple paragraphs of text.
  The default value of -1 means that the first line of each paragraph is ellipsized.
  This behavior may be changed in the future to act per layout instead of per
  paragraph. File a bug against pango at
  [https://gitlab.gnome.org/gnome/pango](https://gitlab.gnome.org/gnome/pango)
  if your code relies on this behavior.

  Height setting only has effect if a positive width is set on
  @layout and ellipsization mode of @layout is not %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE.
  The behavior is undefined if a height other than -1 is set and
  ellipsization mode is set to %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE, and may change in the
  future. *)
  external set_height : t -> int -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_height"

  (** Sets the default font description for the layout.

  If no font description is set on the layout, the
  font description from the layout's context is used. *)
  external set_font_description : t -> Font_description.t option -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_font_description"

  (** Sets the type of ellipsization being performed for @layout.

  Depending on the ellipsization mode @ellipsize text is
  removed from the start, middle, or end of text so they
  fit within the width and height of layout set with
  [method@Pango.Layout.set_width] and [method@Pango.Layout.set_height].

  If the layout contains characters such as newlines that
  force it to be layed out in multiple paragraphs, then whether
  each paragraph is ellipsized separately or the entire layout
  is ellipsized as a whole depends on the set height of the layout.

  The default value is %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE.

  See [method@Pango.Layout.set_height] for details. *)
  external set_ellipsize : t -> Pango_enums.ellipsizemode -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_ellipsize"

  (** Sets whether to calculate the base direction
  for the layout according to its contents.

  When this flag is on (the default), then paragraphs in @layout that
  begin with strong right-to-left characters (Arabic and Hebrew principally),
  will have right-to-left layout, paragraphs with letters from other scripts
  will have left-to-right layout. Paragraphs with only neutral characters
  get their direction from the surrounding paragraphs.

  When %FALSE, the choice between left-to-right and right-to-left
  layout is done according to the base direction of the layout's
  `PangoContext`. (See [method@Pango.Context.set_base_dir]).

  When the auto-computed direction of a paragraph differs from the
  base direction of the context, the interpretation of
  %PANGO_ALIGN_LEFT and %PANGO_ALIGN_RIGHT are swapped. *)
  external set_auto_dir : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_auto_dir"

  (** Sets the text attributes for a layout object.

  References @attrs, so the caller can unref its reference. *)
  external set_attributes : t -> Attr_list.t option -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_attributes"

  (** Sets the alignment for the layout: how partial lines are
  positioned within the horizontal space available.

  The default alignment is %PANGO_ALIGN_LEFT. *)
  external set_alignment : t -> Pango_enums.alignment -> unit = "ml_pango_layout_set_alignment"

  (** Serializes the @layout for later deserialization via [func@Pango.Layout.deserialize].

  There are no guarantees about the format of the output across different
  versions of Pango and [func@Pango.Layout.deserialize] will reject data
  that it cannot parse.

  The intended use of this function is testing, benchmarking and debugging.
  The format is not meant as a permanent storage format. *)
  external serialize : t -> Pango_enums.layoutserializeflags -> Glib_bytes.t = "ml_pango_layout_serialize"

  (** Computes a new cursor position from an old position and a direction.

  If @direction is positive, then the new position will cause the strong
  or weak cursor to be displayed one position to right of where it was
  with the old cursor position. If @direction is negative, it will be
  moved to the left.

  In the presence of bidirectional text, the correspondence between
  logical and visual order will depend on the direction of the current
  run, and there may be jumps when the cursor is moved off of the end
  of a run.

  Motion here is in cursor positions, not in characters, so a single
  call to this function may move the cursor over multiple characters
  when multiple characters combine to form a single grapheme. *)
  external move_cursor_visually : t -> bool -> int -> int -> int -> int * int = "ml_pango_layout_move_cursor_visually"

  (** Queries whether the layout had to wrap any paragraphs.

  This returns %TRUE if a positive width is set on @layout,
  ellipsization mode of @layout is set to %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE,
  and there are paragraphs exceeding the layout width that have
  to be wrapped. *)
  external is_wrapped : t -> bool = "ml_pango_layout_is_wrapped"

  (** Queries whether the layout had to ellipsize any paragraphs.

  This returns %TRUE if the ellipsization mode for @layout
  is not %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE, a positive width is set on @layout,
  and there are paragraphs exceeding that width that have to be
  ellipsized. *)
  external is_ellipsized : t -> bool = "ml_pango_layout_is_ellipsized"

  (** Converts from an index within a `PangoLayout` to the onscreen position
  corresponding to the grapheme at that index.

  The returns is represented as rectangle. Note that `pos->x` is
  always the leading edge of the grapheme and `pos->x + pos->width` the
  trailing edge of the grapheme. If the directionality of the grapheme
  is right-to-left, then `pos->width` will be negative. *)
  external index_to_pos : t -> int -> Rectangle.t = "ml_pango_layout_index_to_pos"

  The X position is measured from the left edge of the line. *)
  external index_to_line_x : t -> int -> bool -> int * int = "ml_pango_layout_index_to_line_x"

  (** Gets the wrap mode for the layout.

  Use [method@Pango.Layout.is_wrapped] to query whether
  any paragraphs were actually wrapped. *)

  (** Gets the width to which the lines of the `PangoLayout` should wrap. *)
  external get_width : t -> int = "ml_pango_layout_get_width"

  (** Counts the number of unknown glyphs in @layout.

  This function can be used to determine if there are any fonts
  available to render all characters in a certain string, or when
  used in combination with %PANGO_ATTR_FALLBACK, to check if a
  certain font supports all the characters in the string. *)

  (** Gets the text in the layout.

  The returned text should not be freed or modified. *)

  (** Gets the current `PangoTabArray` used by this layout.

  If no `PangoTabArray` has been set, then the default tabs are
  in use and %NULL is returned. Default tabs are every 8 spaces.

  The return value should be freed with [method@Pango.TabArray.free]. *)

  (** Gets the amount of spacing between the lines of the layout. *)
  external get_spacing : t -> int = "ml_pango_layout_get_spacing"

  units.

  This is simply a convenience function around [method@Pango.Layout.get_extents]. *)

  See [method@Pango.Layout.set_single_paragraph_mode]. *)
  external get_single_paragraph_mode : t -> bool = "ml_pango_layout_get_single_paragraph_mode"

  (** Returns the current serial number of @layout.

  The serial number is initialized to an small number larger than zero
  when a new layout is created and is increased whenever the layout is
  changed using any of the setter functions, or the `PangoContext` it
  uses has changed. The serial may wrap, but will never have the value 0.
  Since it can wrap, never compare it with "less than", always use "not equals".

  This can be used to automatically detect changes to a `PangoLayout`,
  and is useful for example to decide whether a layout needs redrawing.
  To force the serial to be increased, use
  [method@Pango.Layout.context_changed]. *)
  external get_serial : t -> int = "ml_pango_layout_get_serial"

  (** Determines the logical width and height of a `PangoLayout` in device
  units.

  [method@Pango.Layout.get_size] returns the width and height
  scaled by %PANGO_SCALE. This is simply a convenience function
  around [method@Pango.Layout.get_pixel_extents]. *)
  external get_pixel_size : t -> int * int = "ml_pango_layout_get_pixel_size"

  (** Computes the logical and ink extents of @layout in device units.

  This function just calls [method@Pango.Layout.get_extents] followed by
  two [func@extents_to_pixels] calls, rounding @ink_rect and @logical_rect
  such that the rounded rectangles fully contain the unrounded one (that is,
  passes them as first argument to [func@Pango.extents_to_pixels]). *)

  (** Retrieves an array of logical attributes for each character in
  the @layout.

  This is a faster alternative to [method@Pango.Layout.get_log_attrs].
  The returned array is part of @layout and must not be modified.
  Modifying the layout will invalidate the returned array.

  The number of attributes returned in @n_attrs will be one more
  than the total number of characters in the layout, since there
  need to be attributes corresponding to both the position before
  the first character and the position after the last character. *)

  (** Gets the font description for the layout, if any. *)
  external get_font_description : t -> Font_description.t option = "ml_pango_layout_get_font_description"

  (** Computes the logical and ink extents of @layout.

  Logical extents are usually what you want for positioning things. Note
  that both extents may have non-zero x and y. You may want to use those
  to offset where you render the layout. Not doing that is a very typical
  bug that shows up as right-to-left layouts not being correctly positioned
  in a layout with a set width.

  The extents are given in layout coordinates and in Pango units; layout
  coordinates begin at the top left corner of the layout. *)
  external get_extents : t -> Rectangle.t * Rectangle.t = "ml_pango_layout_get_extents"

  The strong cursor location is the location where characters of the

  The weak cursor location is the location where characters of the
  directionality opposite to the base direction of the layout are inserted.

  The following example shows text with both a strong and a weak cursor.

  cursor to the left. Typing a 'c' in this situation will insert the
  character after the 'b', and typing another Hebrew character, like 'ג',
  will insert it at the end. *)
