type t = [`pixbuf_animation_iter | `object_] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Used to determine how to respond to the area_updated signal on
#GdkPixbufLoader when loading an animation.

The `::area_updated` signal is emitted for an area of the frame currently
streaming in to the loader. So if you're on the currently loading frame,
you will need to redraw the screen for the updated area. *)
external on_currently_loading_frame : t -> bool = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_animation_iter_on_currently_loading_frame"

(** Gets the current pixbuf which should be displayed.

The pixbuf might not be the same size as the animation itself
(gdk_pixbuf_animation_get_width(), gdk_pixbuf_animation_get_height()).

This pixbuf should be displayed for gdk_pixbuf_animation_iter_get_delay_time()
milliseconds.

The caller of this function does not own a reference to the returned
pixbuf; the returned pixbuf will become invalid when the iterator
advances to the next frame, which may happen anytime you call
gdk_pixbuf_animation_iter_advance().

Copy the pixbuf to keep it (don't just add a reference), as it may get
recycled as you advance the iterator. *)
external get_pixbuf : t -> Pixbuf.t = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_animation_iter_get_pixbuf"

(** Gets the number of milliseconds the current pixbuf should be displayed,
or -1 if the current pixbuf should be displayed forever.

The `g_timeout_add()` function conveniently takes a timeout in milliseconds,
so you can use a timeout to schedule the next update.

Note that some formats, like GIF, might clamp the timeout values in the
image file to avoid updates that are just too quick. The minimum timeout
for GIF images is currently 20 milliseconds. *)
external get_delay_time : t -> int = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_animation_iter_get_delay_time"
