(** Create a new PixbufLoader *)
external new_ : unit -> t = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_loader_new"

(* Methods *)
(** Causes the image to be scaled while it is loaded.

The desired image size can be determined relative to the original
size of the image by calling gdk_pixbuf_loader_set_size() from a
signal handler for the ::size-prepared signal.

Attempts to set the desired image size  are ignored after the
emission of the ::size-prepared signal. *)
external set_size : t -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_loader_set_size"

(** Queries the #GdkPixbuf that a pixbuf loader is currently creating.

In general it only makes sense to call this function after the
[signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-prepared] signal has been
emitted by the loader; this means that enough data has been read
to know the size of the image that will be allocated.

If the loader has not received enough data via gdk_pixbuf_loader_write(),
then this function returns `NULL`.

The returned pixbuf will be the same in all future calls to the loader,
so if you want to keep using it, you should acquire a reference to it.

Additionally, if the loader is an animation, it will return the "static
image" of the animation (see gdk_pixbuf_animation_get_static_image()). *)
external get_pixbuf : t -> Pixbuf.t option = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf"

(** Obtains the available information about the format of the
currently loading image file. *)
external get_format : t -> Pixbuf_format.t option = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_format"

(** Queries the #GdkPixbufAnimation that a pixbuf loader is currently creating.

In general it only makes sense to call this function after the
[signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-prepared] signal has been emitted by
the loader.

If the loader doesn't have enough bytes yet, and hasn't emitted the `area-prepared`
signal, this function will return `NULL`. *)
external get_animation : t -> Pixbuf_animation.t option = "ml_gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_animation"

(** Informs a pixbuf loader that no further writes with
gdk_pixbuf_loader_write() will occur, so that it can free its
internal loading structures.

This function also tries to parse any data that hasn't yet been parsed;
if the remaining data is partial or corrupt, an error will be returned.

If `FALSE` is returned, `error` will be set to an error from the
`GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR` or `G_FILE_ERROR` domains.

If you're just cancelling a load rather than expecting it to be finished,
passing `NULL` for `error` to ignore it is reasonable.

Remember that this function does not release a reference on the loader, so
you will need to explicitly release any reference you hold. *)
