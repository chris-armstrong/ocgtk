(* PathBuilder: PathBuilder *)

(** `GskPathBuilder` is an auxiliary object for constructing
`GskPath` objects.

A path is constructed like this:

|[<!-- language="C" -->
GskPath *
construct_path (void)
{
  GskPathBuilder *builder;

  builder = gsk_path_builder_new ();

  // add contours to the path here

  return gsk_path_builder_free_to_path (builder);
]|

Adding contours to the path can be done in two ways.
The easiest option is to use the `gsk_path_builder_add_*` group
of functions that add predefined contours to the current path,
either common shapes like [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.add_circle]
or by adding from other paths like [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.add_path].

The `gsk_path_builder_add_*` methods always add complete contours,
and do not use or modify the current point.

The other option is to define each line and curve manually with
the `gsk_path_builder_*_to` group of functions. You start with
a call to [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.move_to] to set the starting point
and then use multiple calls to any of the drawing functions to
move the pen along the plane. Once you are done, you can call
[method@Gsk.PathBuilder.close] to close the path by connecting it
back with a line to the starting point.

This is similar to how paths are drawn in Cairo.

Note that `GskPathBuilder` will reduce the degree of added Bézier
curves as much as possible, to simplify rendering. *)

rational quadratic Bézier curves.

Note that this is different from calling [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.line_to]
with the start point in that the contour will be closed. A closed
contour behaves differently from an open one. When stroking, its
start and end point are considered connected, so they will be
joined via the line join, and not ended with line caps. *)

Note: Two points and their tangents do not determine
a unique ellipse, so GSK just picks one. If you need more
precise control, use [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.conic_to]
or [method@Gsk.PathBuilder.svg_arc_to].

will be connected.
