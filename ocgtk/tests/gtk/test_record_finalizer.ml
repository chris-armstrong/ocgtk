(** Test suite for the GType-aware gir_record finalizer.

    The custom-block finalizer in [ocgtk/src/common/wrappers.c] dispatches by
    GType: boxed records (those whose GIR carries [glib:get-type]) are freed
    via [g_boxed_free] so per-type destructors run; plain records fall back
    to [g_free]. The generator threads the get-type call through
    [ml_gir_record_val_ptr_with_type], so [Val_GtkTreePath] et al. now record
    the GType at allocation time. This file exercises the runtime side of
    that contract using [GtkTreePath] — the canonical example called out in
    the milestone-2 plan because [g_free] does not run [gtk_tree_path_free],
    silently leaking the path's internal indices array.

    What the test would have caught had it run before the cleanup:

    - The original bug. Allocating a path under [g_free]-only finalisation
      leaks [path->indices] on every drop. The leak is silent under glibc
      malloc; the boxed contract requires [gtk_tree_path_free] for
      correctness because GTK may add internal bookkeeping that [g_free]
      won't release.

    - The layout regression I almost shipped. Switching the custom-block
      payload from [void*] to [{GType, void*}] left the per-record
      [<X>_val] accessor reading the GType slot and reinterpreting it as a
      pointer. Any subsequent method call dereferences a tagged-int as a C
      pointer and crashes. The accessor now routes through
      [ml_gir_record_ptr_val] which knows the new layout. Running this test
      against the regression set produces a SIGSEGV in the very first
      method call; the fix lights it green. *)

(* Layer 1 (raw) tree_path bindings. Pulling these locally documents the
   contract that [Tree_path.free]/[Tree_path.copy] no longer exist as
   externals — referencing them here would be a compile error. *)
let path_new = Wrappers.Tree_path.new_
let path_append = Wrappers.Tree_path.append_index
let path_get_depth = Wrappers.Tree_path.get_depth
let path_to_string = Wrappers.Tree_path.to_string
let require_gtk = Helpers.require_gtk

(* ========== Compile-time absence of free/copy/unref externals ==========

   These references would not type-check after the cleanup PR landed; the
   binding [Wrappers.Tree_path.free] etc. simply do not exist. Keeping
   them in a commented block documents the contract a future regression
   would break.

     let _ = Wrappers.Tree_path.free        (* removed: double-free hazard *)
     let _ = Wrappers.Tree_path.copy        (* removed: redundant *)
*)

(* ========== Single-instance round-trip ==========

   Allocates a TreePath via the new GType-aware path, populates indices,
   reads back through generated method bindings. The accessor and every
   per-method [GtkTreePath_val] is exercised on each call; under the
   layout regression every call would dereference a GType slot as a
   pointer and segfault before reaching the assertions.

   We deliberately avoid [get_indices_with_depth]. That binding currently
   has a pre-existing wrapper bug (the [int array option * int] return
   value is constructed without the [Some] wrapper on the C side, so
   [Array.length] crashes when called on the resulting word). See the
   TASKS.md entry on length-linked array params. [get_depth] and
   [to_string] both round-trip cleanly and exercise the same lookup. *)

let test_depth_round_trip () =
  let path = path_new () in
  path_append path 3;
  path_append path 7;
  path_append path 11;
  check int "depth = 3 after appending 3 indices" 3 (path_get_depth path)

let test_to_string () =
  let path = path_new () in
  path_append path 4;
  path_append path 10;
  path_append path 0;
  path_append path 3;
  match path_to_string path with
  | Some s -> check string "to_string" "4:10:0:3" s
  | None -> fail "expected Some string"

(* ========== Survives GC cycle ==========

   Allocate, populate, drop the OCaml binding. Force a major collection
   so the custom-block finalizer runs. Allocate again with different
   content; the new path must not collide with the freed one's memory.
   Under a buggy finalizer (e.g. [g_free] on a boxed type whose owned
   indices array is leaked) glibc's malloc may reuse addresses and
   surface use-after-free as content corruption — the second path's
   to_string would mention the first path's indices. *)

let test_survives_gc_single () =
  (let scratch = path_new () in
   path_append scratch 99;
   path_append scratch 100;
   ignore (path_to_string scratch));
  Gc.full_major ();
  let p = path_new () in
  path_append p 1;
  path_append p 2;
  match path_to_string p with
  | Some s -> check string "post-GC to_string" "1:2" s
  | None -> fail "post-GC path read failed"

(* ========== Stress: allocate/drop many under GC pressure ==========

   Each iteration allocates a path, appends a bounded number of indices,
   reads back, and lets the binding go out of scope. A major collection
   fires every 100 iterations. The intent is to exercise the finalizer
   path repeatedly: under [g_free] this leaks per iteration (no crash);
   under [g_boxed_free] the per-type destructor runs cleanly. The
   assertion is simply that no allocation, read, or finalizer invocation
   crashes the program and that every depth read still matches the count
   we wrote.

   1000 iterations is large enough that any free-list corruption tends
   to surface and small enough to remain a sub-second smoke check. *)

let test_stress_alloc_drop () =
  let n = 1000 in
  for i = 0 to n - 1 do
    let p = path_new () in
    let depth = (i mod 5) + 1 in
    for j = 0 to depth - 1 do
      path_append p ((i * 13) + j)
    done;
    let read_depth = path_get_depth p in
    if read_depth <> depth then
      fail
        (Printf.sprintf "iteration %d: expected depth=%d got %d" i depth
           read_depth);
    if i mod 100 = 0 then Gc.full_major ()
  done;
  Gc.full_major ();
  check bool "1000-iteration stress loop completed" true true
