(* FlowBoxChild: FlowBoxChild *)

(** The kind of widget that can be added to a [GtkFlowBox].

    {{!Ocgtk.Raw.Flow_box}[Gtk.FlowBox]} will automatically wrap its children in
    a [GtkFlowBoxChild] when necessary.

    The class built on this module is in {!Ocgtk.Flow_box_child}. *)

type t =
  [ `flow_box_child | `widget | `initially_unowned | `object_ ] Gobject.obj

external gtype : unit -> Gobject.Type.t = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_get_type"

external new_ : unit -> t = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_new"
(** Creates a new [GtkFlowBoxChild].

    This should only be used as a child of a [GtkFlowBox]. *)

(* Methods *)

external set_child :
  t ->
  Event_controller_and__layout_child_and__layout_manager_and__root_and__tooltip_and__widget
  .Widget
  .t
  option ->
  unit = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_set_child"
(** Sets the child widget of [self]. *)

external is_selected : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_is_selected"
(** Returns whether the [child] is currently selected in its [GtkFlowBox]
    container. *)

external get_index : t -> int = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_get_index"
(** Gets the current index of the [child] in its [GtkFlowBox] container. *)

external get_child :
  t ->
  Event_controller_and__layout_child_and__layout_manager_and__root_and__tooltip_and__widget
  .Widget
  .t
  option = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_get_child"
(** Gets the child widget of [self]. *)

external changed : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_flow_box_child_changed"
(** Marks [child] as changed, causing any state that depends on this to be
    updated.

    This affects sorting and filtering.

    Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the data used for the
    sorting and filtering functions. For instance, if the list is mirroring some
    external data set, and {i two} children changed in the external data set
    when you call gtk_flow_box_child_changed() on the first child, the sort
    function must only read the new data for the first of the two changed
    children, otherwise the resorting of the children will be wrong.

    This generally means that if you don’t fully control the data model, you
    have to duplicate the data that affects the sorting and filtering functions
    into the widgets themselves.

    Another alternative is to call
    {{!Ocgtk.Raw.Flow_box.val-invalidate_sort}[Gtk.FlowBox.invalidate_sort]} on
    any model change, but that is more expensive. *)

(* Properties *)

val on_activate :
  ?after:bool -> t -> callback:(unit -> unit) -> Gobject.Signal.handler_id
(** Emitted when the user activates a child widget in a [GtkFlowBox].

    This can happen either by clicking or double-clicking, or via a keybinding.

    This is a keybinding signal, but it can be used by applications for their
    own purposes.

    The default bindings are <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. *)
