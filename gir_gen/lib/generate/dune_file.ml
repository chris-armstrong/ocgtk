(* Order the stub file names for batching.

   Every class stub file (ml_button_gen, ml_box_gen, ...) depends on the
   enum converter file (ml_<ns>_enums_gen) of its namespace, but the
   native linker emits the -cclib archive flags in the reverse of the
   order the batch libraries are listed, so the first-listed batch
   (batch_0) is scanned *last* by ld. Chunking a plain alphabetical list
   therefore leaves class stubs whose enum converter landed in an
   earlier-listed batch unable to resolve it whenever nothing else pulls
   the converter archive in first — exactly what happens in executables
   that only reference class stubs from the first batch (e.g. tests
   using Button/Box but no Widget/Window).

   Enum converter files are the only stubs that everything else
   depends on while depending on nothing, so listing them first — and
   thus inside batch_0, where the single-archive rescan of ld resolves
   the mutual references with the batch_0 class stubs — makes every
   cross-batch reference flow towards later-scanned archives. *)
