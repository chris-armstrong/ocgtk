(* Unit tests for Dune_file — stub-batch layout.

    The generated C stubs are split into batch libraries because of the
    Windows command-line length limit. OCaml's native linker emits the -cclib
    archive flags in the reverse of the order the libraries are listed, so the
    first-listed batch (batch_0) is scanned *last* by ld. Batch_0 must
    therefore hold the leaf converter files (ml_<ns>_enums_gen) that every
    class stub file depends on: with alphabetical chunking they land mid
    sequence, and any executable that pulls only batch_0 class stubs (e.g. a
    test using Button/Box but no Widget/Window) fails to link because the
    enums archive was scanned before anything referenced it.

    These tests pin the ordering invariant: enums converters first, everything
    else alphabetical, chunking stable. *)
