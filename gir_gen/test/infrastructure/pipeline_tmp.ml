(** Per-test temp directory for pipeline tests.

    Pipeline tests must place all temp files under [pipeline_tmp/<test-name>/]
    rather than [/tmp]. When run via [dune runtest] the working directory is the
    test stanza's run directory under [_build/<context>/], so the
    [pipeline_tmp/] tree lives inside the build tree and is removed by
    [dune clean]. This avoids host pollution and concurrent-run collisions.

    See [docs/plans/test-suite-remediation.md] § Phase 1.5 for the principle. *)
