# ocgtk Architecture

This directory contains architecture documentation for ocgtk contributors.

Start with **[overview.md](./overview.md)** — it walks through the whole system:
project layout, the binding layers, the gir_gen pipeline, dependency analysis and
cycle handling, dead code elimination, closures and signals, and cross-namespace
types.
