type t = [`test_d_bus | `object_] Gobject.obj

(** Create a new TestDBus *)
external new_ : Gio_enums.testdbusflags -> t = "ml_g_test_dbus_new"

(* Methods *)
(** Start a dbus-daemon instance and set DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS. After this
call, it is safe for unit tests to start sending messages on the session bus.

If this function is called from setup callback of g_test_add(),
g_test_dbus_down() must be called in its teardown callback.

If this function is called from unit test's main(), then g_test_dbus_down()
must be called after g_test_run(). *)
external up : t -> unit = "ml_g_test_dbus_up"

(** Stop the session bus started by g_test_dbus_up().

Unlike g_test_dbus_down(), this won't verify the #GDBusConnection
singleton returned by g_bus_get() or g_bus_get_sync() is destroyed. Unit
tests wanting to verify behaviour after the session bus has been stopped
can use this function but should still call g_test_dbus_down() when done. *)
external stop : t -> unit = "ml_g_test_dbus_stop"

(** Get the flags of the #GTestDBus object. *)
external get_flags : t -> Gio_enums.testdbusflags = "ml_g_test_dbus_get_flags"

(** Get the address on which dbus-daemon is running. If g_test_dbus_up() has not
been called yet, %NULL is returned. This can be used with
g_dbus_connection_new_for_address(). *)
external get_bus_address : t -> string option = "ml_g_test_dbus_get_bus_address"

(** Stop the session bus started by g_test_dbus_up().

This will wait for the singleton returned by g_bus_get() or g_bus_get_sync()
to be destroyed. This is done to ensure that the next unit test won't get a
leaked singleton from this test. *)
external down : t -> unit = "ml_g_test_dbus_down"

(** Add a path where dbus-daemon will look up .service files. This can't be
called after g_test_dbus_up(). *)
external add_service_dir : t -> string -> unit = "ml_g_test_dbus_add_service_dir"

(* Properties *)
