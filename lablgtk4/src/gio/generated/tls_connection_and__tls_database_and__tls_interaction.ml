  peer before the connection is closed, and will return a
  %G_TLS_ERROR_EOF error if the connection is closed without proper
  notification (since this may indicate a network error, or
  man-in-the-middle attack).

  In some protocols, the application will know whether or not the
  connection was closed cleanly based on application-level data
  (because the application-level data includes a length field, or is
  somehow self-delimiting); in this case, the close notify is
  redundant and sometimes omitted. (TLS 1.1 explicitly allows this;
  in TLS 1.0 it is technically an error, but often done anyway.) You
  can use g_tls_connection_set_require_close_notify() to tell @conn
  to allow an "unannounced" connection close, in which case the close
  will show up as a 0-length read, as in a non-TLS
  #GSocketConnection, and it is up to the application to check that
  the data has been fully received.

  Note that this only affects the behavior when the peer closes the
  connection; when the application calls g_io_stream_close() itself
  on @conn, this will send a close notification regardless of the
  setting of this property. If you explicitly want to do an unclean
  close, you can close @conn's #GTlsConnection:base-io-stream rather
  than closing @conn itself, but note that this may only be done when no other

  the problems found. If the function is unable to determine whether
  @chain is valid or not (eg, because @cancellable is triggered
  before it completes) then the return value will be
  %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and @error will be set
  accordingly. @error is not set when @chain is successfully analyzed
  but found to be invalid. *)
  external verify_chain_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (Gio_enums.tlscertificateflags, GError.t) result = "ml_g_tls_database_verify_chain_finish"

  (** Determines the validity of a certificate chain, outside the context
  of a TLS session.

  @chain is a chain of #GTlsCertificate objects each pointing to the next
  certificate in the chain by its #GTlsCertificate:issuer property.

  @purpose describes the purpose (or usage) for which the certificate
  is being used. Typically @purpose will be set to %G_TLS_DATABASE_PURPOSE_AUTHENTICATE_SERVER
  which means that the certificate is being used to authenticate a server
  (and we are acting as the client).

  The @identity is used to ensure the server certificate is valid for
  the expected peer identity. If the identity does not match the
  certificate, %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_BAD_IDENTITY will be set in the
  return value. If @identity is %NULL, that bit will never be set in
  the return value. The peer identity may also be used to check for
  pinned certificates (trust exceptions) in the database. These may
  override the normal verification process on a host-by-host basis.

  Currently there are no @flags, and %G_TLS_DATABASE_VERIFY_NONE should be
  used.

  If @chain is found to be valid, then the return value will be 0. If
  @chain is found to be invalid, then the return value will indicate at
  least one problem found. If the function is unable to determine
  whether @chain is valid (for example, because @cancellable is
  triggered before it completes) then the return value will be
  %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and @error will be set accordingly.
  @error is not set when @chain is successfully analyzed but found to
  be invalid.

  GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
  error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
  that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
  decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
  be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
  expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
  error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.

  Prior to GLib 2.48, GLib's default TLS backend modified @chain to
  represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
  certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
  property of each certificate in @chain. Since GLib 2.48, this no
  longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
  represent the actual certification path used during certificate
  verification.

  Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
  perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
  For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
  revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
  certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
  handle the verification.

  The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
  to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
  certificates.

  This function can block. Use g_tls_database_verify_chain_async() to
  perform the verification operation asynchronously. *)

  Beware this function cannot be used to build certification paths. The
  issuer certificate returned by this function may not be the same as
  the certificate that would actually be used to construct a valid
  certification path during certificate verification.
  [RFC 4158](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4158) explains
  why an issuer certificate cannot be naively assumed to be part of the
  the certification path (though GLib's TLS backends may not follow the
  path building strategies outlined in this RFC). Due to the complexity
  of certification path building, GLib does not provide any way to know
  which certification path will actually be used when verifying a TLS
  certificate. Accordingly, this function cannot be used to make
  security-related decisions. Only GLib itself should make security
  decisions about TLS certificates. *)

  but found to be invalid. *)

  (** Determines the validity of a certificate chain, outside the context
  of a TLS session.

  @chain is a chain of #GTlsCertificate objects each pointing to the next
  certificate in the chain by its #GTlsCertificate:issuer property.

  @purpose describes the purpose (or usage) for which the certificate
  is being used. Typically @purpose will be set to %G_TLS_DATABASE_PURPOSE_AUTHENTICATE_SERVER
  which means that the certificate is being used to authenticate a server
  (and we are acting as the client).

  The @identity is used to ensure the server certificate is valid for
  the expected peer identity. If the identity does not match the
  certificate, %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_BAD_IDENTITY will be set in the
  return value. If @identity is %NULL, that bit will never be set in
  the return value. The peer identity may also be used to check for
  pinned certificates (trust exceptions) in the database. These may
  override the normal verification process on a host-by-host basis.

  Currently there are no @flags, and %G_TLS_DATABASE_VERIFY_NONE should be
  used.

  If @chain is found to be valid, then the return value will be 0. If
  @chain is found to be invalid, then the return value will indicate at
  least one problem found. If the function is unable to determine
  whether @chain is valid (for example, because @cancellable is
  triggered before it completes) then the return value will be
  %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and @error will be set accordingly.
  @error is not set when @chain is successfully analyzed but found to
  be invalid.

  GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
  error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
  that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
  decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
  be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
  expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
  error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.

  Prior to GLib 2.48, GLib's default TLS backend modified @chain to
  represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
  certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
  property of each certificate in @chain. Since GLib 2.48, this no
  longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
  represent the actual certification path used during certificate
  verification.

  Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
  perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
  For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
  revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
  certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
  handle the verification.

  The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
  to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
  certificates.

  This function can block. Use g_tls_database_verify_chain_async() to
  perform the verification operation asynchronously. *)

  Beware this function cannot be used to build certification paths. The
  issuer certificate returned by this function may not be the same as
  the certificate that would actually be used to construct a valid
  certification path during certificate verification.
  [RFC 4158](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4158) explains
  why an issuer certificate cannot be naively assumed to be part of the
  the certification path (though GLib's TLS backends may not follow the
  path building strategies outlined in this RFC). Due to the complexity
  of certification path building, GLib does not provide any way to know
  which certification path will actually be used when verifying a TLS
  certificate. Accordingly, this function cannot be used to make
  security-related decisions. Only GLib itself should make security
  decisions about TLS certificates. *)

  The handle should have been created by calling

  (** Create a handle string for the certificate. The database will only be able

  will be returned.

  and between applications. If a certificate is modified in the database,
  then it is not guaranteed that this handle will continue to point to it. *)
