and is not typically used by other code. *)
external init : t -> unit = "ml_g_static_resource_init"

(** Gets the GResource that was registered by a call to g_static_resource_init().

This is normally used by code generated by

and is not typically used by other code. *)
external get_resource : t -> Resource.t = "ml_g_static_resource_get_resource"

(** Finalized a GResource initialized by g_static_resource_init().
