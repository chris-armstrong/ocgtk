(* Methods *)
(** Passes a file descriptor to the receiving side of the
connection. The receiving end has to call g_unix_connection_receive_fd()
to accept the file descriptor.

As well as sending the fd this also writes a single byte to the
stream, as this is required for fd passing to work on some
implementations. *)
external send_fd : t -> int -> Cancellable.t option -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_unix_connection_send_fd"

(** Passes the credentials of the current user the receiving side
of the connection. The receiving end has to call
g_unix_connection_receive_credentials() (or similar) to accept the
credentials.

As well as sending the credentials this also writes a single NUL
byte to the stream, as this is required for credentials passing to
work on some implementations.

This method can be expected to be available on the following platforms:

- Linux since GLib 2.26
- FreeBSD since GLib 2.26
- GNU/kFreeBSD since GLib 2.36
- Solaris, Illumos and OpenSolaris since GLib 2.40
- GNU/Hurd since GLib 2.40

Other ways to exchange credentials with a foreign peer includes the
#GUnixCredentialsMessage type and g_socket_get_credentials() function. *)

The sending end has to call g_unix_connection_send_fd() for this
to work.
