(* Methods *)
(** Queries a file io stream for the given @attributes.
This function blocks while querying the stream. For the asynchronous
version of this function, see g_file_io_stream_query_info_async().
While the stream is blocked, the stream will set the pending flag
internally, and any other operations on the stream will fail with
%G_IO_ERROR_PENDING.

Can fail if the stream was already closed (with @error being set to
%G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED), the stream has pending operations (with @error being
set to %G_IO_ERROR_PENDING), or if querying info is not supported for
the stream's interface (with @error being set to %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED). I
all cases of failure, %NULL will be returned.

If @cancellable is not %NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
was cancelled, the error %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be set, and %NULL will
be returned. *)
external query_info : t -> string -> Cancellable.t option -> (File_info.t, GError.t) result = "ml_g_file_io_stream_query_info"

(** Gets the entity tag for the file when it has been written.
This must be called after the stream has been written
and closed, as the etag can change while writing. *)
