type t = [`proxy] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Some proxy protocols expect to be passed a hostname, which they
will resolve to an IP address themselves. Others, like SOCKS4, do
not allow this. This function will return %FALSE if @proxy is
implementing such a protocol. When %FALSE is returned, the caller
should resolve the destination hostname first, and then pass a
#GProxyAddress containing the stringified IP address to
g_proxy_connect() or g_proxy_connect_async(). *)
external supports_hostname : t -> bool = "ml_g_proxy_supports_hostname"

(** See g_proxy_connect(). *)
external connect_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (Io_stream.t, GError.t) result = "ml_g_proxy_connect_finish"

(** Given @connection to communicate with a proxy (eg, a
#GSocketConnection that is connected to the proxy server), this
does the necessary handshake to connect to @proxy_address, and if
required, wraps the #GIOStream to handle proxy payload. *)
external connect : t -> Io_stream.t -> Proxy_address.t -> Cancellable.t option -> (Io_stream.t, GError.t) result = "ml_g_proxy_connect"
