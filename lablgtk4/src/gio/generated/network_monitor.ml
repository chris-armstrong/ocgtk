type t = [`network_monitor] Gobject.obj

(* Methods *)
(** Checks if the network is metered.
See #GNetworkMonitor:network-metered for more details. *)
external get_network_metered : t -> bool = "ml_g_network_monitor_get_network_metered"

(** Checks if the network is available. "Available" here means that the
system has a default route available for at least one of IPv4 or
IPv6. It does not necessarily imply that the public Internet is
reachable. See #GNetworkMonitor:network-available for more details. *)
external get_network_available : t -> bool = "ml_g_network_monitor_get_network_available"

(** Gets a more detailed networking state than
g_network_monitor_get_network_available().

If #GNetworkMonitor:network-available is %FALSE, then the
connectivity state will be %G_NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY_LOCAL.

If #GNetworkMonitor:network-available is %TRUE, then the
connectivity state will be %G_NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY_FULL (if there
is full Internet connectivity), %G_NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY_LIMITED (if
the host has a default route, but appears to be unable to actually
reach the full Internet), or %G_NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY_PORTAL (if the
host is trapped behind a "captive portal" that requires some sort
of login or acknowledgement before allowing full Internet access).

Note that in the case of %G_NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY_LIMITED and
%G_NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY_PORTAL, it is possible that some sites are
reachable but others are not. In this case, applications can
attempt to connect to remote servers, but should gracefully fall
back to their "offline" behavior if the connection attempt fails. *)
external get_connectivity : t -> Gio_enums.networkconnectivity = "ml_g_network_monitor_get_connectivity"

(** Finishes an async network connectivity test.
See g_network_monitor_can_reach_async(). *)
external can_reach_finish : t -> Async_result.t -> (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_network_monitor_can_reach_finish"

(** Attempts to determine whether or not the host pointed to by
@connectable can be reached, without actually trying to connect to
it.

This may return %TRUE even when #GNetworkMonitor:network-available
is %FALSE, if, for example, @monitor can determine that
@connectable refers to a host on a local network.

If @monitor believes that an attempt to connect to @connectable
will succeed, it will return %TRUE. Otherwise, it will return
%FALSE and set @error to an appropriate error (such as
%G_IO_ERROR_HOST_UNREACHABLE).

Note that although this does not attempt to connect to
@connectable, it may still block for a brief period of time (eg,
trying to do multicast DNS on the local network), so if you do not
want to block, you should use g_network_monitor_can_reach_async(). *)
