(* Properties *)

(** Sets the amount of space between rows of @grid. *)
external set_row_spacing : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_set_row_spacing"

(** Sets whether all rows of @grid will have the same height. *)
external set_row_homogeneous : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_set_row_homogeneous"

(** Sets how the baseline should be positioned on @row of the
grid, in case that row is assigned more space than is requested.

The default baseline position is %GTK_BASELINE_POSITION_CENTER. *)
external set_row_baseline_position : t -> int -> Gtk_enums.baselineposition -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_set_row_baseline_position"

(** Sets the amount of space between columns of @grid. *)
external set_column_spacing : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_set_column_spacing"

(** Sets whether all columns of @grid will have the same width. *)
external set_column_homogeneous : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_set_column_homogeneous"

(** Sets which row defines the global baseline for the entire grid.

Each row in the grid can have its own local baseline, but only
one of those is global, meaning it will be the baseline in the
parent of the @grid. *)
external set_baseline_row : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_set_baseline_row"

(** Removes a row from the grid.

Children that are placed in this row are removed,
spanning children that overlap this row have their
height reduced by one, and children below the row
are moved up. *)
external remove_row : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_remove_row"

(** Removes a column from the grid.

Children that are placed in this column are removed,
spanning children that overlap this column have their
width reduced by one, and children after the column
are moved to the left. *)
external remove_column : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_remove_column"

(** Removes a child from @grid.

The child must have been added with
[method@Gtk.Grid.attach] or [method@Gtk.Grid.attach_next_to]. *)
external remove : t -> Event_controller_and__layout_child_and__layout_manager_and__root_and__widget.Widget.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_remove"

(** Inserts a row at the specified position.

Children which are attached at or below this position
are moved one row down. Children which span across this
position are grown to span the new row. *)
external insert_row : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_insert_row"

(** Inserts a row or column at the specified position.

The new row or column is placed next to @sibling, on the side
determined by @side. If @side is %GTK_POS_TOP or %GTK_POS_BOTTOM,
a row is inserted. If @side is %GTK_POS_LEFT of %GTK_POS_RIGHT,
a column is inserted. *)
external insert_next_to : t -> Event_controller_and__layout_child_and__layout_manager_and__root_and__widget.Widget.t -> Gtk_enums.positiontype -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_insert_next_to"

(** Inserts a column at the specified position.

Children which are attached at or to the right of this position
are moved one column to the right. Children which span across this
position are grown to span the new column. *)
external insert_column : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_grid_insert_column"

(** Returns the amount of space between the rows of @grid. *)
external get_row_spacing : t -> int = "ml_gtk_grid_get_row_spacing"

(** Returns whether all rows of @grid have the same height. *)
external get_row_homogeneous : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_grid_get_row_homogeneous"

(** Returns the baseline position of @row.

See [method@Gtk.Grid.set_row_baseline_position]. *)

(** Returns the amount of space between the columns of @grid. *)

(** Returns whether all columns of @grid have the same width. *)
external get_column_homogeneous : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_grid_get_column_homogeneous"

(** Gets the child of @grid whose area covers the grid
cell at @column, @row. *)

(** Returns which row defines the global baseline of @grid. *)
external get_baseline_row : t -> int = "ml_gtk_grid_get_baseline_row"

(** Adds a widget to the grid.

The widget is placed next to @sibling, on the side determined by
@side. When @sibling is %NULL, the widget is placed in row (for
left or right placement) or column 0 (for top or bottom placement),
at the end indicated by @side.

Attaching widgets labeled `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` with `@sibling == %NULL` and
`@side == %GTK_POS_LEFT` yields a layout of `[3][2][1]`. *)

(** Adds a widget to the grid.

The position of @child is determined by @column and @row.
The number of “cells” that @child will occupy is determined
by @width and @height. *)
