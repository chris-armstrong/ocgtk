(** This resets the default sort function to be in the “unsorted” state.  That
is, it is in the same order as the child model. It will re-sort the model
to be in the same order as the child model only if the `GtkTreeModelSort`
is in “unsorted” state. *)

returned path will point to the same location in the model not being

point to the same row in the sorted model.  If @child_path isn’t a valid

(** This function should almost never be called.  It clears the @tree_model_sort
of any cached iterators that haven’t been reffed with
gtk_tree_model_ref_node().  This might be useful if the child model being
sorted is static (and doesn’t change often) and there has been a lot of
unreffed access to nodes.  As a side effect of this function, all unreffed
iters will be invalid. *)
