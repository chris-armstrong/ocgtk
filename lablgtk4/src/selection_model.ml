(** Make selection changes.

This is the most advanced selection updating method that allows
the most fine-grained control over selection changes. If you can,
you should try the simpler versions, as implementations are more
likely to implement support for those.

Requests that the selection state of all positions set in @mask
be updated to the respective value in the @selected bitmask.

In pseudocode, it would look something like this:

```c
for (i = 0; i < n_items; i++)
  {
    // don't change values not in the mask
    if (!gtk_bitset_contains (mask, i))
      continue;

    if (gtk_bitset_contains (selected, i))
      select_item (i);
    else
      unselect_item (i);
  }

gtk_selection_model_selection_changed (model,
                                       first_changed_item,
                                       n_changed_items);
```

@mask and @selected must not be modified. They may refer to the
same bitset, which would mean that every item in the set should
be selected. *)
external set_selection : t -> Gtk.widget -> Gtk.widget -> bool = "ml_gtk_selection_model_set_selection"

(** Helper function for implementations of `GtkSelectionModel`.

Call this when the selection changes to emit the
[signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed] signal. *)

(** Checks if the given item is selected. *)
external is_selected : t -> int -> bool = "ml_gtk_selection_model_is_selected"

(** Gets the set of selected items in a range.

This function is an optimization for
[method@Gtk.SelectionModel.get_selection] when you are only
interested in part of the model's selected state. A common use
case is in response to the [signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed]
signal. *)
external get_selection_in_range : t -> int -> int -> Gtk.widget = "ml_gtk_selection_model_get_selection_in_range"

(** Gets the set containing all currently selected items in the model.

This function may be slow, so if you are only interested in single item,
consider using [method@Gtk.SelectionModel.is_selected] or if you are only
interested in a few, consider [method@Gtk.SelectionModel.get_selection_in_range]. *)
