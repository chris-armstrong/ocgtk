(* Properties *)

(** Sets the `GtkAdjustment` value.

The value is clamped to lie between [property@Gtk.Adjustment:lower]
and [property@Gtk.Adjustment:upper].

Note that for adjustments which are used in a `GtkScrollbar`,
the effective range of allowed values goes from
[property@Gtk.Adjustment:lower] to
[property@Gtk.Adjustment:upper] - [property@Gtk.Adjustment:page-size]. *)
external set_value : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_set_value"

(** Sets the maximum value of the adjustment.

Note that values will be restricted by `upper - page-size`
if the page-size property is nonzero.

See [method@Gtk.Adjustment.set_lower] about how to compress
multiple emissions of the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed]
signal when setting multiple adjustment properties. *)
external set_upper : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_set_upper"

(** Sets the step increment of the adjustment.

See [method@Gtk.Adjustment.set_lower] about how to compress
multiple emissions of the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed]
signal when setting multiple adjustment properties. *)
external set_step_increment : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_set_step_increment"

(** Sets the page size of the adjustment.

See [method@Gtk.Adjustment.set_lower] about how to compress
multiple emissions of the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed]
signal when setting multiple adjustment properties. *)
external set_page_size : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_set_page_size"

(** Sets the page increment of the adjustment.

See [method@Gtk.Adjustment.set_lower] about how to compress
multiple emissions of the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed]
signal when setting multiple adjustment properties. *)
external set_page_increment : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_set_page_increment"

(** Sets the minimum value of the adjustment.

When setting multiple adjustment properties via their individual
setters, multiple [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed] signals will
be emitted. However, since the emission of the
[signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed] signal is tied to the emission
of the ::notify signals of the changed properties, it’s possible
to compress the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed] signals into one
by calling g_object_freeze_notify() and g_object_thaw_notify()
around the calls to the individual setters.

Alternatively, using a single g_object_set() for all the properties
to change, or using [method@Gtk.Adjustment.configure] has the same effect. *)
external set_lower : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_set_lower"

(** Gets the current value of the adjustment. *)
external get_value : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_value"

(** Retrieves the maximum value of the adjustment. *)
external get_upper : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_upper"

(** Retrieves the step increment of the adjustment. *)
external get_step_increment : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_step_increment"

(** Retrieves the page size of the adjustment. *)
external get_page_size : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_page_size"

(** Retrieves the page increment of the adjustment. *)
external get_page_increment : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_page_increment"

(** Gets the smaller of step increment and page increment. *)
external get_minimum_increment : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_minimum_increment"

(** Retrieves the minimum value of the adjustment. *)
external get_lower : t -> float = "ml_gtk_adjustment_get_lower"

(** Sets all properties of the adjustment at once.

Use this function to avoid multiple emissions of the
[signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed] signal. See
[method@Gtk.Adjustment.set_lower] for an alternative
way of compressing multiple emissions of
[signal@Gtk.Adjustment::changed] into one. *)
external configure : t -> float -> float -> float -> float -> float -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_adjustment_configure_bytecode" "ml_gtk_adjustment_configure_native"

(** Updates the value property to ensure that the range
between @lower and @upper is in the current page.

The current page goes from `value` to `value` + `page-size`.
If the range is larger than the page size, then only the
start of it will be in the current page.

A [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::value-changed] signal will be emitted
if the value is changed. *)
