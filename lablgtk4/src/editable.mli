(** Changes the size request of the editable to be about the
right size for @n_chars characters.

Note that it changes the size request, the size can still
be affected by how you pack the widget into containers.
If @n_chars is -1, the size reverts to the default size. *)
external set_width_chars : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_width_chars"

(** Sets the text in the editable to the given value.

This is replacing the current contents. *)
external set_text : t -> string -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_text"

(** Sets the cursor position in the editable to the given value.

The cursor is displayed before the character with the given (base 0)
index in the contents of the editable. The value must be less than
or equal to the number of characters in the editable. A value of -1
indicates that the position should be set after the last character
of the editable. Note that @position is in characters, not in bytes. *)
external set_position : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_position"

(** Sets the desired maximum width in characters of @editable. *)
external set_max_width_chars : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_max_width_chars"

(** If enabled, changes to @editable will be saved for undo/redo
actions.

This results in an additional copy of text changes and are not
stored in secure memory. As such, undo is forcefully disabled
when [property@Gtk.Text:visibility] is set to %FALSE. *)
external set_enable_undo : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_enable_undo"

(** Determines if the user can edit the text in the editable widget. *)
external set_editable : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_editable"

(** Sets the alignment for the contents of the editable.

This controls the horizontal positioning of the contents when
the displayed text is shorter than the width of the editable. *)
external set_alignment : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_set_alignment"

(** Selects a region of text.

The characters that are selected are those characters at positions
from @start_pos up to, but not including @end_pos. If @end_pos is
negative, then the characters selected are those characters from
@start_pos to  the end of the text.

Note that positions are specified in characters, not bytes. *)
external select_region : t -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_select_region"

(** Sets up a delegate for `GtkEditable`.

This is assuming that the get_delegate vfunc in the `GtkEditable`
interface has been set up for the @editable's type.

This is a helper function that should be called in instance init,
after creating the delegate object. *)
external init_delegate : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_init_delegate"

(** Gets the number of characters of space reserved
for the contents of the editable. *)
external get_width_chars : t -> int = "ml_gtk_editable_get_width_chars"

(** Retrieves the contents of @editable.

The returned string is owned by GTK and must not be modified or freed. *)
external get_text : t -> string = "ml_gtk_editable_get_text"

(** Retrieves the current position of the cursor relative
to the start of the content of the editable.

Note that this position is in characters, not in bytes. *)
external get_position : t -> int = "ml_gtk_editable_get_position"

(** Retrieves the desired maximum width of @editable, in characters. *)
external get_max_width_chars : t -> int = "ml_gtk_editable_get_max_width_chars"

(** Gets if undo/redo actions are enabled for @editable *)
external get_enable_undo : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_editable_get_enable_undo"

(** Retrieves whether @editable is editable. *)
external get_editable : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_editable_get_editable"

(** Gets the `GtkEditable` that @editable is delegating its
implementation to.

Typically, the delegate is a [class@Gtk.Text] widget. *)
external get_delegate : t -> Gtk.widget option = "ml_gtk_editable_get_delegate"

(** Gets the alignment of the editable. *)
external get_alignment : t -> float = "ml_gtk_editable_get_alignment"

(** Undoes the setup done by [method@Gtk.Editable.init_delegate].

This is a helper function that should be called from dispose,
before removing the delegate object. *)
external finish_delegate : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_finish_delegate"

(** Deletes a sequence of characters.

The characters that are deleted are those characters at positions
from @start_pos up to, but not including @end_pos. If @end_pos is
negative, then the characters deleted are those from @start_pos to
the end of the text.

Note that the positions are specified in characters, not bytes. *)
external delete_text : t -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_delete_text"

(** Deletes the currently selected text of the editable.

This call doesn’t do anything if there is no selected text. *)
external delete_selection : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_editable_delete_selection"

(** Retrieves the accessible platform state from the editable delegate.

This is an helper function to retrieve the accessible state for
`GtkEditable` interface implementations using a delegate pattern.

You should call this function in your editable widget implementation
of the [vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_platform_state] virtual function, for
instance:

```c
static void
accessible_interface_init (GtkAccessibleInterface *iface)
{
  iface->get_platform_state = your_editable_get_accessible_platform_state;
}

static gboolean
your_editable_get_accessible_platform_state (GtkAccessible *accessible,
                                             GtkAccessiblePlatformState state)
{
  return gtk_editable_delegate_get_accessible_platform_state (GTK_EDITABLE (accessible), state);
}
``` *)
external delegate_get_accessible_platform_state : t -> Gtk_enums.accessibleplatformstate -> bool = "ml_gtk_editable_delegate_get_accessible_platform_state"
