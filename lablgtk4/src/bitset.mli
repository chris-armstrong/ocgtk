(* Record: Bitset *)

(** A `GtkBitset` represents a set of unsigned integers.

Another name for this data structure is "bitmap".

The current implementation is based on [roaring bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/).

A bitset allows adding a set of integers and provides support for set operations
like unions, intersections and checks for equality or if a value is contained
in the set. `GtkBitset` also contains various functions to query metadata about
the bitset, such as the minimum or maximum values or its size.

The fastest way to iterate values in a bitset is [struct@Gtk.BitsetIter].

The main use case for `GtkBitset` is implementing complex selections for
[iface@Gtk.SelectionModel]. *)

external new_empty : unit -> t = "ml_gtk_bitset_new_empty"

(** Create a new Bitset *)
external new_range : int -> int -> t = "ml_gtk_bitset_new_range"

(** Releases a reference on the given `GtkBitset`.

If the reference was the last, the resources associated to the @self are
freed. *)
external unref : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_unref"

(** Sets @self to be the union of @self and @other.

That is, add all values from @other into @self that weren't part of it.

It is allowed for @self and @other to be the same bitset. Nothing will
happen in that case. *)
external union : t -> Obj.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_union"

(** Sets @self to be the subtraction of @other from @self.

In other words, remove all values from @self that are part of @other.

It is allowed for @self and @other to be the same bitset. The bitset
will be emptied in that case. *)
external subtract : t -> Obj.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_subtract"

(** This is a support function for `GListModel` handling, by mirroring
the `GlistModel::items-changed` signal.

First, it "cuts" the values from @position to @removed from
the bitset. That is, it removes all those values and shifts
all larger values to the left by @removed places.

Then, it "pastes" new room into the bitset by shifting all values
larger than @position by @added spaces to the right. This frees
up space that can then be filled. *)
external splice : t -> int -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_splice"

(** Shifts all values in @self to the right by @amount.

Values that end up too large to be held in a #guint are discarded. *)

(** Shifts all values in @self to the left by @amount.

Values smaller than @amount are discarded. *)
external shift_left : t -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_shift_left"

(** Interprets the values as a 2-dimensional boolean grid with the given @stride
and inside that grid, removes a rectangle with the given @width and @height. *)
external remove_rectangle : t -> int -> int -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_remove_rectangle"

(** Removes the closed range [@first, @last], so @first, @last and all
values in between. @first must be smaller than @last. *)

(** Removes all values from @start (inclusive) to @start + @n_items (exclusive)
in @self. *)

(** Removes all values from the bitset so that it is empty again. *)

external ref : t -> Obj.t = "ml_gtk_bitset_ref"

(** Check if no value is contained in bitset. *)
external is_empty : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_bitset_is_empty"

(** Sets @self to be the intersection of @self and @other.

In other words, remove all values from @self that are not part of @other.

It is allowed for @self and @other to be the same bitset. Nothing will
happen in that case. *)
external intersect : t -> Obj.t -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_intersect"

(** Returns the value of the @nth item in self.

If @nth is >= the size of @self, 0 is returned. *)
external get_nth : t -> int -> int = "ml_gtk_bitset_get_nth"

(** Returns the smallest value in @self.

If @self is empty, `G_MAXUINT` is returned. *)
external get_minimum : t -> int = "ml_gtk_bitset_get_minimum"

(** Returns the largest value in @self.

If @self is empty, 0 is returned. *)
external get_maximum : t -> int = "ml_gtk_bitset_get_maximum"

(** Returns %TRUE if @self and @other contain the same values. *)
external equals : t -> Obj.t -> bool = "ml_gtk_bitset_equals"

(** Sets @self to be the symmetric difference of @self and @other.

The symmetric difference is set @self to contain all values that
were either contained in @self or in @other, but not in both.
This operation is also called an XOR.

It is allowed for @self and @other to be the same bitset. The bitset
will be emptied in that case. *)

(** Interprets the values as a 2-dimensional boolean grid with the given @stride
and inside that grid, adds a rectangle with the given @width and @height. *)
external add_rectangle : t -> int -> int -> int -> int -> unit = "ml_gtk_bitset_add_rectangle"

values in between. @first must be smaller than @last. *)

(exclusive) in @self. *)
