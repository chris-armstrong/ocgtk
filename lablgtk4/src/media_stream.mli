(** Same as gtk_media_stream_stream_unprepared(). *)
external unprepared : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_unprepared"

(** Resets a given media stream implementation.

[method@Gtk.MediaStream.stream_prepared] can then be called again.

This function will also reset any error state the stream was in. *)
external stream_unprepared : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_stream_unprepared"

(** Pauses the media stream and marks it as ended.

This is a hint only, calls to [method@Gtk.MediaStream.play]
may still happen.

The media stream must be prepared when this function is called. *)
external stream_ended : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_stream_ended"

(** Sets the volume of the audio stream.

This function call will work even if the stream is muted.

The given @volume should range from 0.0 for silence to 1.0
for as loud as possible. Values outside of this range will
be clamped to the nearest value.

If the stream has no audio or is muted, calling this function
will still work but it will not have an immediate audible effect.
When the stream is unmuted, the new volume setting will take effect. *)
external set_volume : t -> float -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_set_volume"

(** Starts or pauses playback of the stream. *)
external set_playing : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_set_playing"

(** Sets whether the audio stream should be muted.

Muting a stream will cause no audio to be played, but it
does not modify the volume. This means that muting and
then unmuting the stream will restore the volume settings.

If the stream has no audio, calling this function will
still work but it will not have an audible effect. *)
external set_muted : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_set_muted"

(** Sets whether the stream should loop.

In this case, it will attempt to restart playback
from the beginning instead of stopping at the end.

Not all streams may support looping, in particular
non-seekable streams. Those streams will ignore the
loop setting and just end. *)
external set_loop : t -> bool -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_set_loop"

(** Ends a seek operation started via GtkMediaStream.seek() successfully.

This function will unset the GtkMediaStream:ended property
if it was set.

See [method@Gtk.MediaStream.seek_failed] for the other way of
ending a seek. *)
external seek_success : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_seek_success"

(** Ends a seek operation started via GtkMediaStream.seek() as a failure.

This will not cause an error on the stream and will assume that
playback continues as if no seek had happened.

See [method@Gtk.MediaStream.seek_success] for the other way of
ending a seek. *)
external seek_failed : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_seek_failed"

(** Starts playing the stream.

If the stream is in error or already playing, do nothing. *)
external play : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_play"

(** Pauses playback of the stream.

If the stream is not playing, do nothing. *)
external pause : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_pause"

(** Checks if there is currently a seek operation going on. *)
external is_seeking : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_is_seeking"

(** Checks if a stream may be seekable.

This is meant to be a hint. Streams may not allow seeking even if
this function returns %TRUE. However, if this function returns
%FALSE, streams are guaranteed to not be seekable and user interfaces
may hide controls that allow seeking.

It is allowed to call [method@Gtk.MediaStream.seek] on a non-seekable
stream, though it will not do anything. *)
external is_seekable : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_is_seekable"

(** Returns whether the stream has finished initializing.

At this point the existence of audio and video is known. *)
external is_prepared : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_is_prepared"

(** Returns whether the stream has video. *)
external has_video : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_has_video"

(** Returns whether the stream has audio. *)
external has_audio : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_has_audio"

(** Returns the volume of the audio for the stream.

See [method@Gtk.MediaStream.set_volume] for details. *)
external get_volume : t -> float = "ml_gtk_media_stream_get_volume"

(** Return whether the stream is currently playing. *)
external get_playing : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_get_playing"

(** Returns whether the audio for the stream is muted.

See [method@Gtk.MediaStream.set_muted] for details. *)
external get_muted : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_get_muted"

(** Returns whether the stream is set to loop.

See [method@Gtk.MediaStream.set_loop] for details. *)
external get_loop : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_get_loop"

(** Returns whether the streams playback is finished. *)
external get_ended : t -> bool = "ml_gtk_media_stream_get_ended"

(** Pauses the media stream and marks it as ended.

This is a hint only, calls to [method@Gtk.MediaStream.play]
may still happen.

The media stream must be prepared when this function is called. *)
external ended : t -> unit = "ml_gtk_media_stream_ended"
