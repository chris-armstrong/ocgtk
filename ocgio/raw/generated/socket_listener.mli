(* SocketListener: SocketListener *)

(** A [GSocketListener] is an object that keeps track of a set of server sockets
    and helps you accept sockets from any of the socket, either sync or async.

    Add addresses and ports to listen on using [Gio.SocketListener.add_address]
    and [Gio.SocketListener.add_inet_port]. These will be listened on until
    [Gio.SocketListener.close] is called. Dropping your final reference to the
    [GSocketListener] will not cause [Gio.SocketListener.close] to be called
    implicitly, as some references to the [GSocketListener] may be held
    internally.

    If you want to implement a network server, also look at
    {{!Ocgio.Raw.Socket_service}[Gio.SocketService]} and
    {{!Ocgio.Raw.Threaded_socket_service}[Gio.ThreadedSocketService]} which are
    subclasses of [GSocketListener] that make this even easier.

    The class built on this module is in {!Ocgio.Socket_listener}. *)

type t = [ `socket_listener | `object_ ] Gobject.obj

external gtype : unit -> Gobject.Type.t = "ml_gio_socket_listener_get_type"

external new_ : unit -> t = "ml_g_socket_listener_new"
(** Creates a new [GSocketListener] with no sockets to listen for. New listeners
    can be added with e.g. g_socket_listener_add_address() or
    g_socket_listener_add_inet_port(). *)

(* Methods *)

external set_backlog : t -> int -> unit = "ml_g_socket_listener_set_backlog"
(** Sets the listen backlog on the sockets in the listener. This must be called
    before adding any sockets, addresses or ports to the [GSocketListener] (for
    example, by calling g_socket_listener_add_inet_port()) to be effective.

    See g_socket_set_listen_backlog() for details *)

external close : t -> unit = "ml_g_socket_listener_close"
(** Closes all the sockets in the listener. *)

external add_socket :
  t ->
  Socket_and__socket_connection.Socket.t ->
  [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj option ->
  (bool, GError.t) result = "ml_g_socket_listener_add_socket"
(** Adds [socket] to the set of sockets that we try to accept new clients from.
    The socket must be bound to a local address and listened to.

    For parallel calls to {{!Ocgio.Raw.Socket_listener}[Gio.SocketListener]}
    methods to work, the socket must be in non-blocking mode. (See
    [Gio.Socket:blocking].)

    [source_object] will be passed out in the various calls to accept to
    identify this particular source, which is useful if you're listening on
    multiple addresses and do different things depending on what address is
    connected to.

    The [socket] will not be automatically closed when the [listener] is
    finalized unless the listener held the final reference to the socket. Before
    GLib 2.42, the [socket] was automatically closed on finalization of the
    [listener], even if references to it were held elsewhere. *)

external add_inet_port :
  t -> UInt16.t -> [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj option -> (bool, GError.t) result
  = "ml_g_socket_listener_add_inet_port"
(** Helper function for g_socket_listener_add_address() that creates a TCP/IP
    socket listening on IPv4 and IPv6 (if supported) on the specified port on
    all interfaces.

    If possible, the {{!Ocgio.Raw.Socket_listener}[Gio.SocketListener]} will
    listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 (listening on the same port on both). If
    listening on one of the socket families fails, the
    {{!Ocgio.Raw.Socket_listener}[Gio.SocketListener]} will only listen on the
    other. If listening on both fails, an error will be returned.

    If you need to distinguish whether listening on IPv4 or IPv6 or both was
    successful, connect to [Gio.SocketListener::event].

    [source_object] will be passed out in the various calls to accept to
    identify this particular source, which is useful if you're listening on
    multiple addresses and do different things depending on what address is
    connected to.

    Call g_socket_listener_close() to stop listening on [port]; this will not be
    done automatically when you drop your final reference to [listener], as
    references may be held internally. *)

external add_any_inet_port :
  t -> [ `object_ ] Gobject.obj option -> (UInt16.t, GError.t) result
  = "ml_g_socket_listener_add_any_inet_port"
(** Listens for TCP connections on any available port number for both IPv6 and
    IPv4 (if each is available).

    This is useful if you need to have a socket for incoming connections but
    don't care about the specific port number.

    If possible, the {{!Ocgio.Raw.Socket_listener}[Gio.SocketListener]} will
    listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 (listening on the same port on both). If
    listening on one of the socket families fails, the
    {{!Ocgio.Raw.Socket_listener}[Gio.SocketListener]} will only listen on the
    other. If listening on both fails, an error will be returned.

    If you need to distinguish whether listening on IPv4 or IPv6 or both was

(** The number of outstanding connections in the listen queue. *)

external set_listen_backlog : t -> int -> unit

(** The number of outstanding connections in the listen queue. *)

(** Emitted when [listener]'s activity on [socket] changes state. Note that when
    [listener] is used to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6, a separate set of
    signals will be emitted for each, and the order they happen in is undefined.
